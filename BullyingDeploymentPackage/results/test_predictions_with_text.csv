This is meant to be an encyclopedia, not like social media websites where they eagerly accept any & all user-generated content. So it may appear ``hostile`` to those whose expectations are formed in using those other websites. To reduce the chances that a new user will have a bad experience, it would be better to argue for measures to let them know, before they post their contributions, that we do in fact have limits to what we accept and do demand scads of references. That, and educating new page patrollers and restricting new or clueless users from doing patrolling.

Back in the real world - see all that evidence on Wikipediocracy - I've been trying to post that here from day one, because I came up with it. The reason why you can't see it anywhere here, is because corrupt bastards like Future know that for every Wikipedian who has a clue, there's plenty who are as retarded as you, and will believe him when he says it never existed, and that I'm a troll.

"Extended comments about this The comments by BritishWatcher show the problems at present.  I gave him a simple choice, assume good faith and take me at my word, or buy the book. Instead he chose option C, whine and assume bad faith.  He asserts I have not provided an alternate text written from the source instead of the current text. If he had bothered to read the discussion, he would realise I have said more than once that it is not possible to construct an accurate, non-misleading sentence that belongs in the lead of the article from that source. So I cannot do that.  The problems are quite simple:  *The original sentence which was copied to the lead (complete with egregious modifications of the original sentence to mean something completely different!) did not match the source, and is therefore unsourced. *It is impossible to construct an accurate, non-misleading sentence that belongs in the lead of the article from that source. *Various editors have produced no sources at all to support any figures about injuries or opinions they have said should be included in the lead. *Various editors refuse to allow an unsourced (as the text does not match the source in any way) sentence to be removed from the article. They are so insistent on retaining an incorrect, unsourced sentence. Not only that, they keep proposing equally incorrect, unsourced sentences that either cite zero sources or inaccurately cite the existing source. *I have asked many times why the reader should be misled. It is quite telling that nobody dare give me a straight policy based answer to that question, especially when the protection policy allows for its removal.  When one side's discussion involves nothing more than assumptions of bad faith, stalling, stonewalling and making things up from thin air, it is obvious where the problem lies.     ",0,0

"`  == Name is not a pseudonym ==  The man changed his name to the current name which is Mark A. Gabriel. So, Mark A. Gabriel is the new real name for this man.  This is from the introduction page of ``Islam and Terrorism``;  The NAME YOU see on the cover of this book is not the Muslim name that was given to me by my parents in Egypt. However, I would like to say that I have no desire to deceive Muslims, Christians or anyone else about my name in order to benefit my self. Rather, I have chosen my name for the following reasons.  Reason #1 After I left Egypt, I went to South Africa and was discipled in Christ there. When I began ministering to Muslims in South Africa, I became very well known by my Muslim name. For four years radical Muslims pursued me diligently. I had to hide all the time and change my residency from one city to another almost on a monthly basis. When I wrote my first book in South Africa, my pastor and I discussed whether I should put my name on it. We decided to change my name for security reasons.  Reason #2 I was not comfortable living my Christianity by a Muslim name. I felt my Muslim name was part of my old man. When a person called me by that  name, it reminded me of my old life. I want to live by a Christian name.  Choice of name I chose the first name of Mark because Mark was a writer of the Gospels. Mark was also the first Christian who went to Egypt with the Good News. When Jesus sent the seventy out from Jerusalem, Mark brought the gospel to the city of Alexandria in Egypt. I chose the last name of Gabriel because Gabriel was the angel who brought the good news of the coming of the Messiah to the virgin Mary. Also this was the name of the first Christian person I met in South Africa who took me into his home and invited me to his church.  This proves that this man is not a hoax, and is not more than one author.  |  `",0,0

There was no ``additional law``. The AVNOJ decree of 21 Nov 1944 was passed into law by the Belgrade decision of 6 Feb 1945. It was the same thing. If you are interested, what the AVNOJ decision actually said was this: ``‘Decision on the transition of enemy property into state ownership, on state administration over the property of absent persons, and on sequestration of property forcibly appropriated by occupation authorities’. Article 1 of the mentioned decision states precisely the status of ethnic Germans: ``To be transferred into state ownership on the day this Decision becomes effective: 1. All property of the German Reich and its citizens situated on the territory of Yugoslavia; 2. All property owned by persons of German nationality, with the exception of those Germans who were members of the National Liberation Army and Yugoslav partisan formations, or are citizens of a neutral country who displayed no animosity during enemy occupation; 3. All property of war criminals and their accomplices, with no regard to nationality....``. Full details can be found here;  :::3) It's untrue that Nov 44 decree/Feb 45 law ``cancelled the Yugoslav citizenship of the country’s ethnic Germans`` - this happened later, in the summer of 1945, through their loss of voting rights. Specifically, the Provisional Plenary Assembly of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia passed a citizenship law on 23 August 1945 which stipulated in article 16 that members of those nationalities “whose states had taken part in the war against the peoples of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, and who, during or before the war, by disloyal  behaviour, had violated the national and public interests of the peoples of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, and hence their duty as citizens thereof”, could be deprived of their Yugoslavian citizenship - it's here;  :::4) It's quite hard to see how any of the stuff in question here can be converted into criticism of Tito.   `",0,0

The main reason why I was initially blocked was because of Bigcat82, as his false accusations, bias moderating, lies, misinformation and more lies...7 different people have noted he was bias, and still he is allowed to control the lion vs tiger section with only repeating its not reliable or not a peer journal, none of this is true, for instance, his account where he put on lion vs tiger has been sitting there for going on 6 years and still no one has even peered into it, it is a straight up lie that he said the lion was killed, here is the full article of the 1909 fight:  [url]http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NuqIbte0hB8/T8DE0k29m2I/AAAAAAAAyuI/uNemgrJ-vfI/s1600/Anotherfightatbostocks.jpg[/url]  Miss informs people, and twists facts, he uses this tactics on the roman accounts, leaving out who won in popmeii and following it in with a non credible source William bridges is not a historian, but he uses it to capitalize on the archaeology book, in fact that book roots to the fact the lion defeated the tiger, as roman/italian sites says the tiger is being attacked by a lion: [url]http://www.romanoimpero.com/2010/01/pompei.html[/url]  He routes it to the usual that it was a leopard, but the leopard mosaic is in the house of doves, the lion standing over a prostrated tiger is in the house of faun. Several members point out his major flaws such as Bbbeto, as he states its not that the sources arnt reliable he just doesnt want anything that favors the lion and will show the lion as the usual winner, its not that they arent peer jorunals, its that the support the lion, he has erased over 20 things not seeable now on the talk page and edit page, it doesnt matter if its from a trainer, if they support the lion he will call it unreliable and the rules dont apply...what rules? Its only his rules, there hasnt been a consensus done by 10 people at once going on over 6 years? Is this what wiki is for, for who ever is the more persistent and the better liar to be able to control wiki? Its just his ) and he should be banned from editing that topic, since he is already a part of over 20 forums specifically on topic where he has been caught lying, for instance he just said he has graduated from 10 university's... [url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BigCat82[/url]  Really he graduated from 10 of the top university around the world? Show us just one of them, name the university, show us who you studied under, show us a copy of your diploma, he is a pathological liar, look under the bear contributions countless of people call him specifically a tiger fan, look at the talk page there, the lion vs tiger contribution, only he is ever erasing things of favoring the lion, Wikipedia mods should be ashamed for having a person use its search engine for a person pumping out his own propaganda and bias POV for this amount of time unchecked. He now says that no experts favor a lion, really? Define expert, if we look at what wiki has as expert: [url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert[/url]  We can see that an expert is someone who has pro-longed experience or observation, the topic is about them fighting, so they have to have excerpts and citations of them seeing a fight...no excerpts of them exist for the tiger so far, yet he disputes people who does, and is considered experts.  -Clyde beatty -Terrel jaccobs -Bert nelson -Peter taylor -Dave hoover -Damoo dhotre -Marco Peters -Isablela thomas -William blackburne -George conklin -Dave salmoni -Samatha stephens -Dr antle from big cat rescue -Dr Frank mendel  There are alot of experts who favor the lion, yet he will just lie and lie and lie that they dont, just like the accounts, there are 50 tigers killed by lions just from Clyde beatty alone:  [url]http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/139517086?searchTerm=clyde%20beatty%2050%20tigers%20killed&searchLimits;=[/url]  Lions have killed tigers hundreds of times, theres even photo evidence of the combatants: [url]http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/83094750?searchTerm=tiger%20pries%20and%20dies%20lion&searchLimits;=[/url] [url]http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/135423123?searchTerm=lion%20tiger%20fight%20turin&searchLimits;=[/url] Yet the only one he accepts is the one to make like the lion is incapable of killing a tiger by highlighting they were small, female, ambushed ect...giving the appeal that lions dont stand a chance, when in fact they are taller at the shoulder, heavier as a species, has more genuine experts who favor the lion over the tiger upon experience, has killed more times then vice versa. The article doesnt have to show a one sided one but a fair assessment should be brought in by atleast 10 peer reviewers, of people who actually read the actual dam article instead of leaving lies, and misinformation by the biggest bias liar on the web. In fact i just left crumbs there, I am not gona participate in aiding this topic on this search engine again, you guys can manipulate the system and misinform people all you like, I will take this info to a proper site where people like Bigcat82 and flatout aka false accusers and liars cant do anything about changing the truth.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown.

"` ==Nash equilibria== The game theory section is quite confused, which is amusing given how straightforward the analysis claims to be.  The article can't decide whether it's talking about a single-round Nash equilibrium, or the Nash equilibrium of a repeated game.  It talks about repetition, and a threatened ``retaliation`` the Predictor, but it describes an equilibrium which doesn't need retaliation or a repeated game at all.  The equilibrium {choose both boxes, predict both boxes} is quite stable for the single-round game, and is the only Nash equilibrium.  Both players choosing ``one box`` is also a Nash equilibrium for the repeated game.  However, when we have a repeated game, another Nash equilibrium is possible.  If the Predictor adopts a strategy ``always choose one box unless the Chooser chose two boxes last round`` then the Chooser can also always choose one box and have no incentive to deviate.  Deviating would net an extra 1,000 for that round, but would cap the maximum payoff at 1,000 in the next round, where it would have been 1,000,000.  Hence, the deviation is discouraged and the equilibrium is stable.  The real question is, is any of this germane to the article's topic?  If this section could be made concise and simple, I could see including it.  I don't see a way to make it concise and still correct unless you want to dismiss the possibility of playing repeatedly.  `",0,0

That and that alone makes me unsuitable for editing any WP article whatsoever. I also think that it is those very rules and policies that gut any integrity a so called minority view article could ever have. The only thing the WP rules and policies have accomplished at the AS article is to prevent useful, important and thoroughly verified information to be included, at the same time irrelevant and factually false claims have been inflated and scattered all through the article. There is no integrity there, very little informative value and a high degree of distortion. If that is the WP idea of ``integrity``, then that is an integrity not worth protecting. And isn't WP supposed to the free and public encyclopedia? If that is the case, why should we be bound by any dictates from Jimmy Wales? We are the editors, not him. He may have founded it, but we are the ones upholding it. By the logic employed by some editors here, the government should be allowed to have total control of the internet, because it was government that ``created`` the internet. That is the principle WP seems to follow, and I reject that principle. I also submit that any rule and policy that is so demonstrably destructive as those employed in editing the AS article can and should be altered or abolished.   `",0,1

"`Bombing of Berlin and the Wehrmachtbericht == I don't want to flame the discussion again but I think that this bit of information should not be neglected. The German Wehrmachtberich, biased as it may be, for the first time mentioned attacks on Berlin on the 22 June 1940. It reads ``Auch in der Nacht zum 22. Juni unternahmen feindliche Flugzeuge Einflüge nach Nord- und Westdeutschland und griffen erstmals auch die Umgebung von Berlin mit Bomben an`` (Also in the night of 22 June did enemy aircraft fly to northern and western Germany and for the first time attacked the area of Berlin with bombs). Cuxhaven, according to the Wehrmachtbericht, was already attacked on 5 September 1939. So while the Wehrmachtbericht admits attacks on German territory as early as 5 September 1939 it does not mention a single attack on Berlin until June 1940. Probably that doesn't mean much to those that think that the Wehrmachtbericht was fake, but consider: not to have mentioned an attack on Berlin at such an early stage of the war when things were still going according to the German plan would have been very untruthful, which the people of Berlin surely would have noticed.     == `",0,0

"` :The figure used on this page isn't the number of people who self-identify as ``Black``, it's the estimated number of people with some degree of African ancestry... in Latin America in general and Venezuela in particular these are very different things - ``black`` only applies to people who have sole or predominately African ancestry, while people of mixed ancestry generally consider themselves ``Brown`` (``Moreno``) on the census (presumably this is what you are calling ``mestizo``). If we simply used the ``Black`` figure from the census we'd be ignoring the large number of people who have mixed African and European/Native American ancestry. We can't use the ``Brown`` figure either, as this would include many people who have both European and Native American ancestry but no African ancestry. So the census figures are no good for us and we need to find a different source that estimates African ancestry directly without using the ``black``/``brown`` colour labels. The 20-30% estimation comes from an official document from the Venezuelan government (the Embassy in the US) which specifically states this as the number of people with African ancestry, so is a reliable source for our purposes. If you have an equal or better reliable source that gives an alternative figure then please let me know what it is.  :The 100% issue is a red herring - ``mestizo`` and ``African ancestry`` are overlapping categories and can't be added together as if they were distinct... ``mestizo`` in Venezuela means a mixture of European, Native American and/or African ancestry, so some of the people included in ``mestizo`` are also included in ``African ancestry`` and you'd be counting them twice if you added the two together. A better check is that we'd expect ``Afican ancestry`` to be all of the ``Black`` category plus part of the ``Brown`` category, so more than 3% and less than 53% - the 20-30% estimate fits this perfectly. :  `",0,0

"` * Some thoughts: :*Yes, if you define ``environmental journal`` as any journal that ever published an article dealing with environmental issues. Determining this will often involve original research and interpretation. :*No, if you go by the inclusion criteria given in the lead of this list: this journal clearly is not ``focused`` on environmental issues, even though they may be included in the scope. :*No, if you go by the journal's homepage, which not even mentions the word ``environmental``. :So it all depends on how you want to define ``environmental journal``. Personally, I would define that as a journal dedicated to environmental issues, not just any journal that occasionally also publishes something related.

Im not Saying it to be a bitch crush your dreams but all I'm saying is if you need that much auto tune just to sound decent bottom line is you can't sing . It may be your dream but you can't force yourself to be naturally good. It just comes. Some weren't born with a good voice like me. you so just stop. LMAO. I love Glozell.. Anyone know the song 5:40 ??? I always wondered how she got the money to pay for all the expensive shit she has I don't hate Bethany I actually enjoy watching her videos however She is definitely getting paid to be on Youtube I'm not intending she doesn't love her subscribers viewers but... Why do you think she posts videos constantly? ... Just sayinn' What's number 9? Lol it's adorable. -Me my dad watching this performance- 5th Harmony Singing: I know it's gunna be I know it's gunna be. My dad: Our very last performance.

Her music sucks I love the boys. to be completely honest I hope Taylor does break Harry's heart so he'll realize what a mess this whole relationship is I love Harry to death but.. ... Um nobody really gives a fuck. TBH you look like the biggest idiot on Youtube talking about Justin Bieber ,The king of pop The founder of dubstep,. Everyone knows he isn't.. So shut up just go. you look dumb. you think I didn't notice by now?... Lol I've been on youtube way to long to not have noticed. I can barley pull of the 'easy mode' Lmao you made me feel like a noob. you're SO SO good... Basically I stopped reading your comment after you calling Zayn a Terrorist.... Like honestly it pisses me off when people call him that. it's sad racial to him he's not a bad guy. none of them are bad. You just let your jealousy keep you from realizing that. you don't have to like their music but why do you hate them?

"` March 2007 (UTC)  The only vandal here is you. Let me clefify some things 4 you,  In the 19th century Ilija Garasanin and the rest of the Serb goverment of that time formed a program called ``Nacertanije``, it was a plan of how to realize the plan of a Great Serbia  on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. This new state would be rulled by Serbs, others would be subjected while Muslims(of any ethnicity) would be distroyed(by genocide sense it´s the only way). They called there Army chetnik, them selfs chetniks and there by this ideology(which is fashist) is chetnik. And any1 who follows it is a chetnik.  The plan failed untill 1918 when the Serbs managed to create a ``Slavic Kingdom`` which was actually ment to become a Serb Kingdom which was with time shown, during WWII the chetniks allied with the Nazis and commited GENOCIDE. After the death of Tito the chetniks ressurected and tried everyting all over again but ones again failed thank God.  Now, the chetnik PROPAGANDA is used to make Serbs think that it is right to do all that and to foole everybothy else, this propaganda includes showing Bosnia as a ``Serb state``, Bosniaks as  ``Serbs``, spreding Islamophobia and Anti-Bosniak settlment or presenting the Serbs as the victoms and so on. THAT site does all that and it is enough to open it and you will see. Now you ain´t nobody so I don´t have to proove anything if you don´t see it then you are either stupid or a chetnik your self.  15:59, 29`",1,0

"   The CIA and the US government historically have admitted that Mexicans are white when they do the census. I   I am curious, the CIA fact book states that the USA is 81.7% white 12.9% black, 4.2% Asian, and 2% others? This adds up to about 100%, what happened to all the Mexicans, and Hispanics? Are they saying that ones a Mexican crosses over the border he or she becomes white? that makes no sense. At what percentage does a mestizo become white, 50%, 75%, or 90%? According to the U.S census if a Mexican marks Mexican on the U.S Census, he or she will be classified as white. This leads to my final question, shouldn’t then most Mexicans be classified white, according to the CIA? Finally, I have been to several parts in Mexico and I have noticed that many, or the majority of Mexicans in central Mexico look whiter than Italians, French and middle eastern, which are classified as white everywhere. A large percentage of the Argentinean population has Amerindian mixture; doesn't that make them Mestizo's? Any ways, we will never know for sure until a large genetic sample is taken. I agree with having a predominate 35-45%; if you look at the Argentina demographics it states that 57% of the population has Amerindian ancestry, but 85-97% of the population states that they are white?

They appear to express a negative POV towards the person. -   == For willmcw ==  I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!  :Why do you delete the number of ``Carson`` appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. -   ::I've copied this discussion to the talk:Biff Rose page. -   :: Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time  magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, ``Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade.`` Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman's uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose's irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly  had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. I did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to Rose are very easily found in his records and his websites.

An Archaeological Assessment of Portions of the Red River Gorge, Daniel Boone National Forest, Kentucky.  Archaeological Report No. 1.  Lexington: Ohio Valley Archaeological Research Associates for U.S. Forest Service, 1977.  I have copied extensive amounts of text because no copyright notice is present — it's a case of .      [page 33] Cowan's investigations at the Roger's Shelters (Po-26 and Po-27) and the Haystack Shelter (Po-47A and B) have provided ethnobotanical analyses of materials obtained under more controlled conditions.  Radiocarbon dates from the Roger's Shelters indicate the site was occupied between the fifth and seventh centuries A.D., and Cowan (1976:97-98) postulates a similar timespan [page 34] for the Haystack Shelter occupation.  Plant food remains from the site include six species of nuts (black walnut, butternut, hickory, chestnut, acorn and hazelnut), four species of fruits (pawpaw, sumac, plum and grape), and four or five possible cultigens (squash or pumpkin, bottle gourd, marsh elder, sunflower, and canary grass).  No corn was recovered.  Fragments of cane basketry, prepared bark, and cordage were also collected (Cowan 1976:87-101).  [page 36] Cowan conducted limited test excavations at two of the bottomland sites (Po-31 and Po-42) in 1974.  One of these sites (the Martin Site, Po-42) produced roughened surface pootery which is similar to ceramics from the Levisa Fork in the extreme Eastern Mountains (Cowan 1976:73-82)...In 1973, members of the Red River Historical Society and volunteers from the university of Kentucky, Department of Anthropology conducted excavations at Mf-32, a single-component Fort Ancient rockshelter site.  Materials recovered included corn husks, cordage, cut cane, two species of nuts, and shell tempered pottery, in addition to lithic materials.  The depth of the deposit (approximately 10-15 cm) suggested a relatively short-term occupancy (Cowan 1975:101-102).  Unfortunately, the materials from Mf-32 have not yet been analyzed and reported.  [page 50] This page notes that Cowan's 1975 survey, undertaken in response to changes in plans for the reservoir, gained stratigraphic information on a multicomponent Archaic site (Po-17) in the valley.  Cowan returned the following year to complete testing at Po-17 and Po-42, and to initiate excavation at Po-47B, a Woodland rockshelter site.  The data recovered from Po-17 confirmed Cowan's 1973 stratigraphic sequence and provided valuable information on the transition between the Late Archaic and Early Woodland cultures in [page 51] the Red River valley (Cowan 1976:ii).  Excavations at the Haystack Shelter (Po-47B), a Late Woodland dry shelter site, uncovered a large quantity of well-preserved organic remains.  Split cane basketry fragments, plant fiber cordage, leather, quids, paleofeces, and numerous plant food remains including both native and exotic cultigens were among the specimens recovered",0,0

"`  == New Section ==  As stated above (by Chris in the ``Conason Op-Ed section``), BigGov is offering an ACORN tract that shows its own participation with NBC in an undercover video sting operation. BigGov is calling foul on the idea that NBC/ACORN were not cited as ``unethical`` as per this operation, and it seems that Chris is suggesting we add this to the article. However, BigGov's argument is fallacious, and adding it would only weigh down this article with a point that would, by necessity, negate itself.  While the legal case with Baltimore ACORN involves local wire-tapping laws, the majority of the valid criticism directed against Giles and O'Keefe has less to do with wire-tapping, or lying to prospective sources, and more to do with their excessive editing, their release methods, and their deliberate inaccessibility to news-groups which they characterize as their ``enemies`` (their words, not mine.)  For example, in the Oct 21 interview with Carol Leonnig by Greta van Susteren, the major criticism offered isnt wire-tapping (which both journalists dismiss). Rather, it's the heavily edited content, the hoakie excuse that ``the battery died``, the police report (which contradicts the BigGov narrative), and the posture contrived through the late release of a video (whose unedited presentation Philly ACORN has been asking for already) (http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/200910210046).  The Columbia Journalism Review criticizes Breitbart, Giles and O'Keefe for blackmailing the attorney general to meet their demands, not for wire-tapping. Greg Marx points out that if Breitbart has crucial info (and Breitbart claims to have evidence of real criminal activities), then he should forthrightly produce it, and not play some weird game with the AG Holder(http://www.cjr.org/the_kicker/well_it_may_deserve_an_award_i.php?page=all&print;=true).  Alexandra Fenwick points out that Giles (in her interview with Sean Hannity) admits to not really knowing what ACORN actually did before she decided to ``expose them``. However commendable Giles's work may be, by taking that approach, Giles represents ``shadows of journalism's muckraking past.`` (http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/acorns_family_tree.php)  So the majority of the criticism of Giles's work has very little to do with wire-tapping (even as per the woebegone Conason quote.) The issues with Giles's videos are that they mis-represent and manipulate information for political purposes, and her neglect of regional wire-tapping laws don't form the meat of the arguments against her work.  From the very beginning of this issue, Breitbart has repeatedly stated that his video-release method was contrived as an attack against what he calls ``the liberal democratic media complex`` (see his Sept, 2009 articles in the Wall Street Journal and in the Washington Times.) This aspect of The BigGov.com agenda saturates the entire video scandal in terms of its execution, it's release, and of the whole fictitious narrative that BigGov has contrived to frame this story (i.e., Breitbart says that the standard newsgroups were ``ignoring`` him, Hannah & James, while in fact all 3 actively refused opportunities that were offered to share their stories with those same newsgroups. This is thoroughly documented in the ACORN Video Controversy entry.) This places BigGov's video work in a completely different category than the work conducted by NBC/ACORN  I have read the source material BigGov offers concerning NBC, and their comparison to their own position. No where in the case citied by BigGov do we see ACORN or NBC claiming that because of this sting, all tax-agents ought to be de-funded or investigated (as BigGov does with ACORN.) No where do they claim that H&R; Block should be shut down, since it is part of a larger ideological complex that the operation was meant to attack (as Breitbart does with ACORN.) We dont have NBC slowly dragging out the release of the story in order to inflict ``maximum damage`` to their ``enemies`` (as Giles & O'Keefe do.) We dont have ACORN or NBC trying to blackmail the Attorney General into catering a witch-hunt at their behest (as Breitbart most recently did), or threatening to release a torrent of damaging videos just before the next election cycle if they are not thus indulged (again, Breitbart's latest stunt.) NBC's undercover work with ACORN is of an entirely different order than the politically saturated, openly hostile and all-encompassing attack which BigGov is staging. That very big difference is what makes Giles's work unethical.  Even if one chooses to indulge the argument about undercover work, I am 100% certain that NBC fully obliged the ethical and legal standards of wiretapping in their targetted area (as any professional organization would) before embarking on that operation.

"`  == Samoa mo Samoa - Mata Usi Wikipedia ==  Samoa (i/səˈmoʊ.ə/; Samoan: Sāmoa, IPA: [ˌsaːˈmoa]), officially the Independent State of Samoa (Samoan: Malo Sa'oloto Tuto'atasi o Sāmoa), formerly known as Western Samoa, is a country encompassing the western part of the Samoan Islands in the South Pacific Ocean. Samoa announced their independence to Aotearoa - New Zealand in 1962. The main island of Samoa is Upolu, and is one of the largest islands in the Polynesian Triangle, next to Savai'i. The capital city, Apia, and Faleolo International Airport are situated on the island of Upolu.  Samoa was admitted to the United Nations on 15 December 1976.[6] The entire island group, inclusive of American Samoa, has been called “Navigators Islands” by late European explorers, who at 3000 years after Polynesia's ``Age of Navigation`` surged into an era of exploration. Before the 20th century because of the Samoans' seafaring skills, and origins of Polynesian culture,    History Main article: History of Samoa Many recent studies into the pre-history of Samoa has been taken up by Asia Pacific Universities, including departments in Aotearoa - New Zealand. In general public education, the Polynesian Expansion is chronologically studied in the range of 3,000 years, leading off at a Lapita site at Mulifanua during the 1970s.[8]  The origins of ``The Samoan Expansions`` are linked to the Pre-historical waves of Southeast Asian expansions which is a continued study in modern research in various scientific disciplines such as Genetics, Linguistics and Anthropology. Scientific research resides on the results that the Samoans originate from, or of, the ancient lines of Austronesian expansions and predecessors during some of the first waves expansions eastward across Southern Asia and Asia Pacific. The Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia through Melanesia between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE is an on going Anthropological interest.[9] The Samoan origins are currently being thoroughly assessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards.  It's theorized that intimate sociocultural and genetic ties were maintained in Pre-historical eras between the Polynesian Lapita colonies. Archaeological record supports Samoan oral History and Genealogy that indicate inter-island exploration, war, colonization, and eras of Monarchal ties between ancient Samoans, Tongans, Fijians, and in Eastern Polynesia orders - Ali'i.    Studio photo depicting preparation of the Samoa 'ava ceremony c. 1911.  Interior of Samoan house, Apia, Urville 1842.At the final arrival of western exploration in the early 18th century. Jacob Roggeveen (1659–1729), a Dutchman, was the first documented to sight the Samoan islands in 1722. This visit was followed by another western explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville (1729–1811), who named them the Navigator Islands in 1768. Contact was limited before the 1830s which is when missionaries and traders began seeking relations with Samoan orders.  Religious missions were cautious in Samoa which began in the late 1830's by John Williams, of the London Missionary Society arriving in Sapapali'i from The Cook Islands and Tahiti.[10] According to Barbara A. West, another western author seeking interests of readers, ``The Samoans were also known to engage in “headhunting,” a practice invoked in ancient Samoan warfare, in which a warrior took the head of his slain opponent to give to his leader, thus taking his Mana.``[11] By that time, the Samoans had gained a reputation of being savage and warlike from a famously published French journal of the times, which insued panic during that time, and a wonder of Samoan invasion. The violent altercations had occurred between a village of Samoa and a French expedition [La Perouse Expedition], who had lost almost the entire crew leaving the expedition adrift, over a French sailor direspecting a Samoan woman.  Later expeditions by the British, German, and American forces, who by the late nineteenth century understood the invaluble oceanic position of Samoan trade, sought it's cooperation in resupply and refueling for coal-fired shipping and whaling.

"Recent Edit  1. Moved the Hariakhan Baba paragraph above Post-Yogananda Claims. According to that entry Hariakhan Baba taught from 1860 (before Paramahansa Yogananda was born) to 1924 (before the publication of the Autobiography of a Yogi in 1946). People accepted and revered Hariakhan Baba as the Babaji since pre-Yogananda times. The timing of his appearance also coincides with Lahiri Mahasaya's Kriya Yoga initiation from Babaji (1861).  2. Corrected a minor spelling error from Hari Dasa to Hari Dass.  3. Added Roy Eugene Davis' name and book as support for the Mahavatar Babaji/Hariakhan Baba theory. Basically,  to show that there is someone from the lineage of the author of Autobiography of a Yogi who agrees with Dass and (Mahendra) Baba's conclusion. Roy Eugene Davis was ordained by Paramahansa Yogananda himself in 1951. So, for someone like him to agree that this Hariakhan Baba is the same as the Mahavatar Babaji mentioned by his Master and venerated by all legitimate kriyabans from the Lahiri Lineage is not a light matter.  4.

Per Wiktionary  lie is an intentional falsehood, which requires knowing the mind of another. Simply because someone is mistaken or wrong doesn't mean they're lying. Secondly, the primary goal of anyone named in an ANI thread should be to get out as quickly and painlessly as possible. Lacking a clear consensus, the way that usually happens is the archivebot. ``Defending`` yourself just resets the archive clock and gives other editors another opportunity to repeat their statement in rebuttal. Don't worry about stuff folks are saying there: no veteran volunteer believes anything not backed by diffs. If no sanctions have come forth after a five day ANI thread, they're unlikely to unless the editor provides justification for them by behaving poorly. Let the others have the last word and go about your business. ::::For all who have commented here today, I'll note the ``old school`` wiki rule for article pages is documented at WP:FOC: Focus on article content during discussions, not on editor conduct; comment on content, not the contributor.

If you simply must comment about another editor, start with their talk page. Note also that if you have the numbers (consensus) on your side you're not required to continue discussion until everyone agrees with you; sometimes the answer is simply to agree to disagree and go with the majority viewpoint. (Naturally soliciting wider participation via WP:RFC or an appropriate noticeboard is always a valid option).

"`   Regarding the ``Speedy Deletion`` of my entry for The Resonance Project  I am unfamiliar with this interface so hopefully this is the proper ``talk`` process.    I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's ``flat-earth society`` type behaviour that I find objectionable.  I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called ``community``.  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the ``Speedy Deletion`` I could find no such option.  When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for ``Nassim Haramein`` and ``The Resonance Project`` in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-``free`` encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.  This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

I don't think you're taking the Anonimu business too seriously, and I find Anittas' intervention rather bizarre, but the key is to keep watching and waiting, and acting when really ready. It's frustrating that he can get away with so much (and his attacks have been pointed out to a number of administrators so far).  B. I too despise the profusion of flags, especially when coupled with recentism. Take for instance a biography I was looking at today: that of Anna Politkovskaya. It starts out nicely, but once she gets shot, spirals quickly out of control. Maybe, just maybe, the assassination deserves its own article, but as for the main article, a serious, scholarly biography would never look like this, especially the ``political reaction`` section.  C. By the way, here are the other ``international reactions`` articles: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

"`   Dear Wikipedia ````Neutrality```` guardian,  Re Saddam Hussein entry, no one has yet to answer my question, why do the live palestinians deserve mention in the  primary intro for a non palestinian leader, but the Slaughtered Kurds of Saddam's own countrymen do not?   You could have Written ``Some parts of the Arab world admired Saddam for standing up to the west``. Without mentioning the Palestinians, just like you refuse to mention the slaughtered  Kurds. But you insist on mentioning the Palestinians, and further conceal any remnant of opposing POV with the fascist's friend, the term  ``human-rights situation`` which you hope anyone can interpret as anything.  Are you claiming that the horrors both existed and didn't exist, depending on who you ask? where are all those dead kurds, then?  revive them! I'm sure they will be glad to read in wikipedia that what was done to them was only ``a situation``. A situation is good. Elain in Seinfeld has situations. comes and goes. They can dig up their graves and go home to watch the reruns.  Never mind the bodies, they will soon rot and everyone would have forgotten all about it. Shhhhhhh. But Only one thing as sure as the Sun existed, didn't it? The palestinians and their glee! thats as solid as Iron! who needs proof? its the Palestinians! Amen! Do you have a paraplegic handy by any chance?   I want to know a rational arumgent of why it is so important and humanitarian to  disguise Saddams undisputed, DNA proven horrors. It must be VERY important. there must be some divine logic here beyond my rationality. Oh, It will upset the palestinians? sure! don't you think Saddam's other little hobbies (other than encouraging palestinians) have upset at least the same number of people or largeer? why do you stifle their emphasis then? Either you stifle ALL non Iraqi effects of Saddam, or you mention them NEUTRALLY that means not ONLY the palestinians!   Are you perhaps saying that 10,000 gassed kurds and their millions of grieving relatives/supporters are less important than 2 million live palestinians with no direct contact to Iraqi affairs other than a blushing glee at Saddam's deeds? if so, how many? how many non-palestinians does it take to die till that issue becomes  important enough to mention if it contrasts the palestinian POV?  a million? 6 million by any chance? does this number mean anything to you or do you just file it in you head as ``Human rights situation``?   and how many palestinians angry that 1+1=2 would it take for you to remove all the henceforth controversial entries on mathematics? 3 palestinians? 4 perhaps? remember how to count women They won't like it unless you count women as 1:2 for men. they might cause something to your ``Human rights situation`` otherwise.   And this pargraph:   an increase in human-rights abuses, notably acts of genocide against Iraqi Kurds. The United States continued to view Saddam with deep suspicion, however, primarly due to his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction  do you have any factual references that dispute any of this? supported FACTS not 'liberal' wishful illusions!   all of it is corroborated in the links!   And this,  ``Thanks for pointing this out. I suspect that it was removed because an anon is getting a kick out replacing non-controversial matter-of-fact statements like the above with overtly emotive, deliberately provocative ones.``  Are you hinting that this sentence: ``While he remained a popular hero among many disaffected Arabs for standing up to the West and for his unflinching support for the Palestinians``  is a NPOV? what proof do you have of his support of the palestinians? are ther any references of this, or just hearsay?  Just call wikipedia the Western Edition of Pravda, and be done with it! (never mind that the Palestinian POV is merely matter of morale, and the opposing POV rests on actual crimes of war! how in your humane conscience can you condone this state of affairs?) And I dont wan't to skewer anyone either. If I wante to Skewer Saddam, I would have called him a Hitler wannabe; Little Stalin,  the prince of evil and so forth. This is skewering.

Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred,  because incompetent ``editors`` who have no skills, no degrees, no expertise, usually no names, have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others. Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who  do 7000 edits, 10,000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1,300 or more and are proud of it. These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins,  bureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD.

That and that alone makes me unsuitable for editing any WP article whatsoever. I also think that it is those very rules and policies that gut any integrity a so called minority view article could ever have. The only thing the WP rules and policies have accomplished at the AS article is to prevent useful, important and thoroughly verified information to be included, at the same time irrelevant and factually false claims have been inflated and scattered all through the article. There is no integrity there, very little informative value and a high degree of distortion. If that is the WP idea of ``integrity``, then that is an integrity not worth protecting. And isn't WP supposed to the free and public encyclopedia? If that is the case, why should we be bound by any dictates from Jimmy Wales? We are the editors, not him. He may have founded it, but we are the ones upholding it. By the logic employed by some editors here, the government should be allowed to have total control of the internet, because it was government that ``created`` the internet. That is the principle WP seems to follow, and I reject that principle. I also submit that any rule and policy that is so demonstrably destructive as those employed in editing the AS article can and should be altered or abolished.   `",1,1

Turned them into around 180 redirects and put together a paltry in-universe list article that had almost zero value... leaving things well enough alone would have been far better. Kidz!!!

What I was thinking was that the ``In economics`` part should move to Poverty line, since in this sense, being in ``absolute poverty`` means nothing more than being below someone's ``poverty line.``  The material left over fot the section on how the phrase is used to mean ``extreme poverty`` is barely more than a dictionary definition, and so should either be moved to Wiktionary, merged with Poverty, or both.   `",0,0

"`  == Misrepresentation of Women in Football ==  Hi Johan. I have some serious concerns about the (probably unintentional) misogynistic POV in Football Project articles and am hoping to enlist your cooperation.  I've attempted, over the past year, to begin correcting the biased POV by: *including women in football articles that previously made it seem as if only men play football or only men play well *creating new content/articles about women's football (e.g.: history, national teams and international competition) *wikifying articles related to women and football  I appreciate your passion for football and the enormous effort you've put into maintaining articles, the portal and the project.  But, it is disconcerting to find my work undone without so much as an attempt to collaborate or find ways to improve the representation of women in Wikipedia football articles. Reverting to the biased content on women's role in soccer (Football (soccer) culture article) as ``soccer mom or fan`` is a violation of NPOV.  And removing the Norwegian Premier League for women link from the Women's football around the world article is counter-productive, in the most generous interpretation.  Perhaps it was not your intention to do anything POV.  I would appreciate if you'd collaborate.  Would you consider helping by finding a group of editors interested in improving the representation of women in football articles?  Thanks.  Deebki `",0,0

Richard works out the purpose of the tumi Inca knife and plunges it into Matt, killing his present form but bringing his past form 10000 years into the future to continue the fight. Scott soon regrets his decision and in a final act of repentance reopens the doors, allowing the others to travel to Antarctica, but in the process killing himself. His past form travels to the future along with Matt's and the five are able to defeat the Old Ones once and for all.`",0,0

"`  == ``First edition preferred`` ==  Hi.  I was amused to see this added to the infobox on The Small Rain, published in 1945. Having collected L'Engle novels for over 30 years, I've still never even SEEN the original cover of this book - and if I did, I'd have to think long and hard before spending several hundred dollars to buy it and scan it for Wikipedia. Rest assured that I will always post first edition covers if I have them, but it's not always possible. For example, my hardback of The Young Unicorns is an ex-library rebinding.  I've searched online for the cover of the first edition, and nobody has one posted.  All I see is lots and lots of copies of the current paperback cover art. No big deal at this end - I know you're just adding standardised info on what we want to post whenever possible. Still, I'll be very surprised if we ever get 100% compliance on L'Engle books of the 1940s to 1960s. Regards, and keep up the good work!  |  |  `",0,0

"`  == criticism of jesus/plucking eyeballs out/slavery ==   Jesus has been criticized as vindictive, intolerant, prudish, and unkind. Several scholars have noted that he appears to condone slavery.   −    −  The cardinal Avery Robert Dulles stated that Jesus “said not a word against slavery as a social institution``, and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either.  In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, ``but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery,” and argues that Jesus must have then condoned it.     −       How come the Catholic removed this section in his words ``because it didn't appear to be criticism`` is this a joke?   −  Friedrich Nietsche argued that “a war was declared on passion” in the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says of sexual temptation: ``If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out.`` According to Nietsche, “Destroying the passions and cravings, merely as a preventive measure against their stupidity and the unpleasant consequences of this stupidity, today this itself strikes us as merely another acute form of stupidity. We no longer admire dentists who ``pluck out`` teeth so that they will not hurt any more…. the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises.”[Friedrich Nietzsche, 1878, Human all too Human: A Book for Free Spirits, The Wanderer and His Shado, aphorism 83] `",1,0

"`   ^You're extremely ignorant, prove what you say with a source..  You can't possibly be being serious! The INDIGENOUS North Africans looked pretty much what modern-day North Africans look like, Caucasoid. Caucasoid is a real racial term also, having to say so is pretty sad really.   ^No it is not a 'real' racial term, I've provided sources that beg to differ with your unprofessional, unexperienced claims.. ``Caucasoid`` is a myth to make certain people feel better.  Also, INDIGENOUS Southern Africans aren't bl;ack either they're Khoisan/Capoid. Also if Africa has the largest degree of diversity in the whole world, how can you believe in a single ``African`` or ``black`` race? Check out the Racial reality sight, or John Baker or Carelton coon's books which blow your politically correct Diop-esque nonsense right out of the water.  ``Black`` is a social term, and there is no such thing as a ``Capoid``, the genetic data doesn't mean to back up that category at all, Khoisan are closely related to pygmies, then to West Africans, there is no break in the genetic link that describes any different type of 'race'..   Quote: Capoid (named after Cape Province, South Africa) along with congoid are one of the two major divisions within the Negroid race http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoid  ^Haha, don't make me laugh, you are not intelligent at all... I'd also expect you to quote an outdated race scientist like Coon, you've obviously been living under a rock for the past 10 years and haven't heard about the Pn2 clade (that unites all Africans, north, south, east, west, and doesn't include so-called ``Caucasoids``) that I posted in the section above you. http://mbe.library.arizona.edu/data/1994/1105/4hamm.pdf  http://www.homestead.com/wysinger/Northeast_african_analysis.pdf  Also, I never said ``so-called Caucasoids`` don't live there now, but they're foreigners, all of them are Arab. Berbers are evenly mixed and so are southern Egyptians and some Ethiopians. Seeing as how ``Caucasoid`` isn't a real race (check my sources again), that makes them ``Black``, because ``Black``, Africoid, Negro, Native African, all the same shit to me when speaking socially, as far as genetic relationships this is confirmed also (check the links I posted above)....  Also, just so you know, originally Africans were only hose Caucasoid peoples that lived in what is present-day Tunisia. As a Caucasoid descendant of Phoenicians, as all Phoenician-descended people are Caucasoids, I find it quite flattering that you Negroids are claiming ``African`` as your ``badge``, but true Africans resemble present-day Arabs, Italians, Jews, Greeks etc Caucasoid Mediterraneans.  Hahahaha!! I love it when people like you say idiotic things, It gives me a chance to show off how much less-ignorant I am than you are. Phonecians were never native to Africa. They were the Canaanites of the bible and migrated to the North African coast in Tunsia in like 1,000 B.C... They were not indigenous to Africa.

Nazlet Khater man was the earliest modern human skeleton found near Luxor, in 1980. The remains was dated from between 35,000 and 30,000 years ago. The report regarding the racial affinity of this skeleton concludes: ``Strong alveolar prognathism combined with fossa praenasalis in an African skull is suggestive of Negroid morphology [form & structure]. The radio-humeral index of Nazlet Khater is practically the same as the mean of Taforalt (76.6). According to Ferembach (1965) this value is near to the Negroid average.`` The burial was of a young man of 17-20 years old, whose skeleton lay in a 160cm- long narrow ditch aligned from east to west. A flint tool, which was laid carefully on the bottom of the grave, dates the burial as contemporaneous with a nearby flint quarry. The morphological features of the Nazlet Khater skeleton were analysed by Thoma (1984). The 35,000 year old skeleton was examined using multivariate statistical procedures. In the first part, principal components analysis is performed on a dataset of mandible dimensions of 220 fossils, sub-fossils and modern specimens, ranging in time from the Late Pleistocene to recent and restricted in space to the African continent and Southern Levant.

"`  == UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! ==  {{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!  One of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.  I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.  The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.  Keith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a ``Mutt and Jeff`` in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1`` but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.  Karen and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.  We were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.  ``There were some really desperate people here tonight,`` she said. ``Can you believe Gary tried to get a game of Spin the Bottle going?``  ``I can't say I really blame him,`` I answered with a grin. ``Not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends, or any girlfriend for that matter. Hell, I wouldn'd mind playing it now!`` That earned me a poke in the ribs from Karen.  Sue chimed in, ``Why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like Spin the Bottle, Post Office, or Strip Poker?``  ``Now that's a stupid question,`` Keith answered.  ``And why is that?`` Linda asked, pointedly.  ``Isn't it obvious?`` Keith replied.  ``No.`` Linda and Sue answered in unison.  ``Do you want to tell them?`` Keith asked me with a nod.  So I explained the obvious. ``Because they ARE desperate - and sometimes it works.``  ``Oh please!`` Karen said.  Keith was a real instigator. ``You guys have never played Spin the Bottle?``  The girls looked at each other. ``Maybe a few times, but certainly not in the last year.`` Linda finally answered.  ``And how about Truth or Dare?`` Keith continued egging them on.  ``Well sure, but usually only with people we know really well,`` Karen answered this time.  ``Usually.`` Keith echoed with a grin. ``And it's not like you've never played Strip Poker.``  The girls looked at each other quietly no one answering.  ``Oh come on,`` I teased, ``Karen I know you've played Strip Poker.``  ``Not really. I watched part of a game, but then they chased everyone not playing out of the room. Why? I suppose you've played it?`` She asked with a dangerous tone in her voice.  ``Sort of. In camp we started a game but it got raided before we got anywhere.`` I confessed, drawing a laugh from the guys. ``Laugh it up, go ahead. Have you guys played it to completion?``  That shut them up.  ``I'll get the cards,`` Linda said.  ``What?`` Sue almost leaped out of her chair. Karen echoed her moments later.  If Karen's gossip was to be believed, Sue had never done more than kissed. Not even a hand-job for poor Tom's troubles. I wasn't surprised that she was against the idea.  ``Come on.`` Linda urged, ``We can't possibly graduate high school and never have played Strip Poker. And if you were ever going to play, can you think of a better crowd to play it with?``  She had a point there. We were all good friends, and nobody in this group would look bad in the buff. We'd all seen each other in pretty immodest attire as it was, and most of us had seen at least one other 'au-naturel'. Plus, we could all keep a confidence within the group.  Keith was about to say something, and I kicked him hard. He looked at me, and I shook my head. I wanted to grab him by the collar and shake him. Let the girls talk each other into it and we stood a pretty good chance, but if we acted like we wanted this, we'd be shot down in moments. This gave me an idea.  ``It's pretty late anyway, and it could get a little awkward.`` I said. Now Tom was looking daggers at me.  ``Geez, Jack. Don't you want to finish your camp game? We're not going to bite.`` Karen teased, belying her words with a nibble on my shoulder.  ``No, you guys can't back down now,`` Linda insisted.  ``So maybe you and I can play our own game,`` Keith told Linda, getting the feel of where I was going.  ``Hell, just get the cards Linda,`` Sue finally spoke up. ``They'll play or we'll just go home.``  I couldn't believe it. The most likely impediment to this game getting off the ground had just threatened to leave if we didn't play.  Alleluia.  * * *  We sat around Keith's dinner table, beers at hand, while I shuffled the cards. ``How do we play?`` I asked.  ``How did you play last time, at camp?`` Sue asked. Her words were a bit slurred, she was still drinking and was by far the smallest person present. Come to think of it, I'd never seen her drunk. I guess there's a first time for everything. Maybe a couple of firsts for Sue tonight.  ``We played straight poker, and the winner could choose one person to remove an item.`` I told them.  ``How did that work?`` Tom asked.  ``Not really good. We had five girls and two guys. We had snuck into their side of camp, and we were losing badly.`` I admitted. ``How did they play the game you were watching?`` I asked Karen.  ``It was crazy. All the losers lost clothing. In like three hands everyone was half-naked.`` She told us.  ``Ouch!`` Linda laughed. ``We're NOT playing that one.``  ``We could play with chips, and have to buy new chips with clothing,`` Tom suggested.  ``Too complicated,`` Linda answered.  ``How about 5 card draw, and the lowest hand loses an item?`` Tom offered.  Keith spoke up, ``There's really no incentive to win. All you care is that you don't lose.``  ``No, that might work.`` I said, offering up my two cents. ``How about this, we play 5 card draw, with the loser removing one item. Also, the winner can make one OTHER person remove an item OR drink a shot. Their choice.``  I watched them ponder that one. A little faster, a little more risky, and more incentive to win. Plus you couldn't pick on one person too badly.  ``I like it,`` Linda finally said.  ``Me too,`` Karen added, and soon we were all agreeing to play ``Jack's Strip and Sip Poker``.  ``So deal 'em up,`` Keith said.  ``One second.`` It was Sue. She wasn't backing down was she? ``How many items does everybody have?``  We had to agree that shoes could be counted individually, and socks were counted as one item. We all had between 3 and 7 items. So the sevens stripped down to six, and we gave Linda, who didn't know where her shoes were, and wasn't wearing socks: a hat, and my shirt (I had a t-shirt underneath) to go with her dress, panties and bra, and we agreed to count her watch. We were almost ready to begin.  ``Keith, what do you have for shots?`` Tom asked.  ``Tequila, Scotch, and Vodka,`` he answered, looking in his parents' bar. He pulled out the Tequila and Scotch. ``We better stick to these, the Vodka is almost empty, and they might notice if we clean 'em out.`` The other bottles were huge, and only a third empty, so we probably wouldn't get busted. We still had beer outside if it came down to it.  Once we had played about half-a-dozen hands it became clear that Tom, Sue and Linda didn't know much about playing poker. They lost 2",1,1

"`  :My quibble was the use of the word ``automatic``.  This suggests, to me, something that happens without human intervention, which surely cannot be the case.  A visa cannot issue itself, law or no law.  The system that issues visas must be informed of the visit of the royal personage, and that information can only be provided by a human.  Effectively, someone, somewhere, has to decide to approve the issuing of this visa, and after that the system does what it needs to do.  To cause such a visa to be denied might be unprecedented and unthinkable, but surely someone, somewhere, has such a hypothetical power.  That it may never be used still does not make the issuing of the visa ``automatic``, in my understanding of the word.   `",0,0

"`  ==Censoring All Dissent: Does Censorship = Science?==  How come there is no criticism of Newton's theory of gravitation on the page?  Afraid of criticism and dissent?  Is Wikipedia afraid of Neutral Points of View or not?  ``Einstein’s theory of gravity is the craziest explanation of the phenomenon imaginable.``  Wallace Thornhill, physicist, 2001  ``Leibniz also disagreed with other aspects of Newtonianism, such as the use of gravity, which he held to be a revival of occultism, and Newton's use of space as an absolute. Leibnizian physics defined motion and therefore space as relational.``  William E. Burns, historian, 2001  ``Leibniz held that the Newtonian universe was imperfect because it occasionally requires God to intervene to prevent it from running down.``  William E. Burns, historian, 2001  ``Leibniz also attacked Newtonian physical ideas, including absolute space and time, [and] the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which he charged introduced an occult force....``  William E. Burns, historian, 2001  ``Like Huygens, Leibniz never accepted Newtonian gravitation.``  Ezio Vailati, philosopher, 1997  ``Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians.``  John M. Keynes, economist, 1936  ``An atom differs from the solar system by the fact that it is not gravitation that makes the electrons go round the nucleus, but electricity.``  Bertrand Russell, physicist/philosopher, 1924  ``...what is really wanted for a truly Natural Philosophy is a supplement to Newtonian mechanics, expressed in terms of the medium which he suspected and sought after but could not attain, and introducing the additional facts, chiefly electrical—especially the fact of variable inertia—discovered since his time…``  Oliver J. Lodge, physicst, February 1921  ``Magnetism is possessed by the whole mass of the earth and universe of heavenly bodies, and is an essence of known demonstration and laws. By adopting it we have the advantage over the gravity theory by the use of the polar relation to magnetism. A magnetic north pole presented to a magnetic south pole, or a south pole to a north pole, attracts, while a north pole to another north pole or a south pole to another repels. This gives to us a better reason than gravitation can for the elliptical orbit of the planets instead of the circular. It also gives us some light on the mystery of the tides, the philosophy of which the profoundest study has not solved. Certain facts are apparent; but for the explanation of the true theory such men as Laplace and Newton, and others more recent, have labored in vain.``  C.H. Kilmer, historian, October 1915  ``Since Newton announced his universal law of gravitation, scientists have accepted and educators taught it, and rarely has it been questioned. Occasionally one has the temerity to say that gravitation is a myth, an invented word to cover scientific ignorance.``  C.H. Kilmer, historian, October 1915  ``What we call mass would seem to be nothing but an appearance, and all inertia to be of electromagnetic origin.``  Henri Poincaré, physicist, 1908  ``...the great truth, accidentally revealed and experimentally confirmed, is fully recognized, that this planet, with all its appalling immensity, is to electric currents virtually no more than a small metal ball....``  Nikola Tesla, physicist, 1904  ``If we were to assert that we knew more of moving objects than this their last-mentioned, experimentally-given comportment with respect to the celestial bodies, we should render ourselves culpable of a falsity.``  Ernst Mach, physicist, 1893  ``...certain theoretical investigations ... appear to me to throw doubt on the utility of very minute gravitational observations.``  George H. Darwin, physicist, 1882  ``The long and constant persuasion that all the forces of nature are mutually dependent, having one common origin, or rather being different manifestations of one fundamental power, has often made me think on the possibility of establishing, by experiment, a connection between gravity and electricity …no terms could exaggerate the value of the relation they would establish.''  Michael Faraday, physicist, 1865  ``Thus, thinking as Newton did (i.e., that all celestial bodies are attracted to the sun and move through empty space), it is extremely improbable that the six planets would move as they do.``  Pierre L. Maupertuis, polymath, 1746  ``...to establish it [gravitation] as original or primitive in certain parts of matter is to resort either to miracle or an imaginary occult quality.``  Gottfreid W.

Instead, you should write like ``Who-and-who suggested that...``.    :::Dorvaq, thank you for the pointer, where I see ``Newspapers, for instance, almost universally refer to any indicted but unconvicted criminal as an alleged criminal.``  Agreed; I use 'alleged' whenever writing about someone where crimes have been charged but not yet proven in a court of law.  Perhaps what I'm trying to ask is more of a common-sense question to which the answer is so obvious that no one has thought to incorporate it in a policy or guideline here.  Trying again, ``Once an accused criminal is convicted in a court of law, is it not both inappropriate and biased to insist on using the word 'alleged' when writing about the charges of which he's been convicted?``  Maybe someone has a pointer to an old discussion or arbitration about this?  It seems that it must have come up in the past.    ::::I'm pretty sure there is no discussion involving the generic use of ``allege`` (or any derivative thereof) specific to before-and-after trials.  However, there has been many discussions of this sort on individual article pages involving criminals. But, most of these discussions have been initiated by either anonymous users or users who contribute very little to Wikipedia besides the article in question.  Perhaps your best bet would to start there unless someone else can provide you with something more informative.  ::::Anyhow, I don't believe this needs to be incorporated into policy/guideline beyond how the word has already been treated.  In terms of law, to allege is to present without proof or without first proving.  Therefore, to state the convicted crime of an offender as an allegation is inherently contradictory. Wikipedia is dedicated to quality and integrity — anything contradictory fails on those two points, but that's my opinion. —     :::::Ah, that last paragraph hits the nail on the head, thanks.  Nothing like logic to prove a point.  I came upon the Megan Kanka article by chance and I remember the case quite well.  It really irked me, after removing all the 'allegeds' and cleaning up the article, to find an old entry on the Talk page stating ``He argues that he was wrongfully convicted; if he admitted to the allegations, they wouldn't be alleged, but he hasn't, so therefore they're 'alleged,' and he's the 'alleged killer.'``  Arrgh!

After I read your message that I should put more references, I put them. Later I noticed that one of the refrences I put may not be permitted because immediately a warning tag came on the article, saying I should use secondary references. That made me to suspect that the reference I picked from the website of Pastor Chris Ojigbani may be the cause of the tag. I put a reference from the ABOUT US of Ojigbani in the space where the article says that he considers his ministry is not a church. So I put that reference because in the ABOUT US, it stated his ministry is not a church. But when I saw the tag, I removed the reference and was able to see an article from a newspaper that states Ojigbani's ministry is not a church. But after changing it, the tag is still on the article. I don't know how to remove it. Kindly help check the article and help remove the tags, if okay.

"` ::``Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/botanists by nationality lists a 4-4 vote, which is hardly a consensus to make the changes you did. Some of the categories you emptied have been around for six months at least, such as British botanists, so it wasn't just an anon (who was most likely  logged out, as the software is wont to do). Although I understand that you personally think nationality is unimportant, that is just your POV; for a high-school teacher in New Zealand or Brazil looking up homegrown botanists for the class to write about, that is quite relevant, and nearly impossible to find out without the subcategories. In any case, you're setting yourself against the hundreds of editors who have built Category:Nationalities by occupation and Category:People by nationality and their thousands of subcategories. Either botanists are fundamentally different from other kinds of people (which could be argued I suppose -) ), or all these other editors are mistaken, in which case you should convince them of their wrongness first before unilaterally emptying out the category. But given that Category:American actors alone has some 3,000 names, I don't think you're going to get much of a favorable hearing! If you want to argue that the botanists is still too small to be subdivided, that's plausible, but your argument seems to be that the category shouldn't be subdivided no matter how large it gets. Just as you expect other people to defer to your knowledge in matters arboreal, you should respect those who are more knowledgeable about information organization.  `` :::Hi Stan - several points; first, neither was there any consensus for Pcpcpc's (if they were his) changes in the first place; I was restoring the original status quo, not making a change. And no request for comment had been made at either WP:TOL talk or from regular botanical contributors, as should have been done, before making that change. Second, botanists are fundamentally different from (almost) all other kinds of people when it comes to nationality; e.g. uniquely only botanists and ornithologists working in Britain and Germany among all people maintained friendly communication and exchange of scientific information throughout the second world war. Third, yes, botanists are too small to subdivide; all but 4 or 5 of the new subcategories created had less than five entries, which is pretty ridiculous; it is not comparable to actors at all. Fourth, and most important of all, is the need to have all the botanists at a single source for reference. There are thousands of plant articles that are being written or having their taxoboxes updated; both involve adding the line {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = | author = }} ; one takes a species, and looks up the botanical name and author citation to enter there, e.g. {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = Pinus ayacahuite| author = Ehrenb. ex Schltdl.}}; this gives you two authors to link in, with no information on their nationality. One can then get their full names from the [http://www.ipni.org/ipni/query_author.html IPNI author query page], but that still leaves the article writer with the task of finding the botanist's wiki page - does the botanist Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal have a page at all? Is it at [[Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Franz von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. L. von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. von Schlechtendal]]? The simple way to do this is to look up in [[:Category:botanists]]. If you have to search through 30-odd subcategories and sub-subcategories - it takes an hour to do something that should take 2 minutes. So you don't, you give up in disgust. Or else start a new duplicate page about the botanist. It is quite clear from both 82.35.37.118's and Pcpcpc's contributions lists, that they've not had any experience at all of writing plant articles, and I think they should listen to those who do. - ~~~~  `",0,0

In this case, rather than attempt to unilaterally downgrade the article I think a better approach might have been to raise the issues you see on the talk page (or simply fix them).  In the future if you're hesitant to ``sign`` an FA or GA rating, then perhaps you should add the rating but not sign it.

"`  My name is Dean Estes. I met Snakefinger (Mr. Lithman) in 1981 when he and his band played on the front lawn of our high school. One of his band members, a former Dead Kennedy, had attended the school and made this cool event possible. I don't know why Steve Crabtree claims that Lithman was American and was not of European descent. Technically it may be true that the UK is not part of ``Europe`` despite being a charter member of the EU, but Mr. Crabtree's claims risk giving an false impression. Phil ``Snakefinger`` Lithman was English, as is easily verified and as was clearly obvious when the man spoke. Perhaps Steve meant that Snakefinger was living in America? (Specifically San Francisco.) Two years later I was fortunate enough to befriend one of The Residents. While I was savvy enough not to ask certain questions until enough trust had been earned, I do recall, during a discussion of the The Residents' remarkably unique sense of harmonization, asking if N. Senada had actually existed. My Resident acquaintance simply smiled and shrugged his shoulders, which I knew was a nice way of saying ``we aren't going there,`` so I didn't pursue it. I believe it's pretty obvious that ``the mysterious N. Senada`` never actually existed when you review the various things that have been said about him. Isn't the amusing play on the name of the Baja Mexican town ``Ensenada`` clue enough? However, this is another case where the question of whether or not such aspects of the Residents mythos ``matter`` is perfectly valid. Of course it doesn't really matter. As one of the people who actually does know the answers to some of the speculation here, it's so strange, seeing how some people post misinformation with conviction (intentionally?) while others deny facts. For the most part, to quote an old Eno lyric, ``those who know, they don't let it show.``  -) Mystery and myth are more fun, and I think it's safe to say that's part of the point of the Residents' myriad mysteries. Nevertheless, while Snakefinger protected The Residents' secrets, he wasn't secretive about his own ``real`` identity or history at all. My apologies to Steve if I've misunderstood him.`",0,0

It takes various forms depending on what the government decides to do, naturally; the more religious-theocratic the government, the more likely it'll be a full branch of the police or even its own group. Take its incarnation in Saudi Arabia and compare it to the village enforcement groups found in northern Pakistani villages, for instance. Or the versions in Egypt and Yemen, which have (at least at this point) more to do about making sure that the only version of Islam practiced is the state-sponsored one.

"  ::::::This is a straw man argument, Mr Merkey.  Nobody is arguing that federally unverified tribes, clans or groups should be identified as having any kind of federal recognition. What's being said here, something that you seem unwilling to accept as even being a valid view, is that those groups claim to have cherokee lineage (in many cases, having verifiable documented evidence to that effect), and as such, they should be figured on the cherokee page, not simply expunged from wikipedia because they don't fall within the very narrow rules defined by the very government that has historically persecuted them. If nothing else, they should be included to highlight the controversy that their claim to being cherokee engenders.  Legally, they may not be recognised cherokees, but anthropologically they are. Removing non federally recognised groups on the basis of some imagined legal threat would seem to be ridiculous; this is intended, after all, to be an encyclopedia, and thus, encyclopedic.

First problem ParacusForward like most wiki editors you don't understand the subject but wiki functions like a micropedia if they want more information the real people's encyclopaediais called Google. Either you don't understand the problems of getting past the big brother police state of Manipur where people are terrified to report the truth or you don't care. I thought perhaps this might be a place to release info but I noticed the spike in info came from reports available via google. One national tv company followed by a local newspaper broke the story on the death threats and hate mail. Then the gangsters responded in an Indian national tabloid. Now they are trying to put the djinn back into the bottle. I don't think you are necessarily malicious the police and security forces wouldn't have to pay you to supress the truth. You are clearly racist or if you prefer the more encylopaediac term ethnocentric. One of the sources the only one I saw that was completely incorrect is a Chinese Government Human Rights Agency. They are not so hot on Tibet and can be truthful on non chinese human rights abuses but in Manipur they have close links with the major human rights NGO which has long been run by the local police. I am sure things will happen but since you haven't got any interest in updating it none will report it here. I don't believe it is helpful either. Wiki did not allow the 24 hours grace to support to keep my fiancee alive again not out of malice but because of aspergers syndrome. I am sending her Hard Times if you haven't read it Wiki does a good summary they are also good for things like definition of satyagraha but for up to date info Google is the first port of call or Twitter. So anyway good luck with your project but the manner in which a few ignorant racist wiki editors claim ownership of this venture with nobody else having the courage to challenge them in case they too are red handed by a confederacy of dunces will make it less relevant. It is far from accurate or up to date. Mainly because editors like you do not have sufficient background understanding of hte politics and culture of the articles you edit. Before I began editing wiki hadn't updated info for several years. No doubt now you will accept unchallenged the false government reports which because they carry the weight of Chinese Propaganda agencies and local newspapers wholly intimidated by the Manipur State and corrupt police will now stand unchallenged by the editors who look only at code grammar and syntax and have no understanding of hte problems of truth reporting from within a police state of the third world.

" :::This is a special case because while it is a commonly accepted usage, it is also commonly accepted usage for a host of other concepts of divinity, that often differ dramatically from the YHWH of the Hebrew Bible and Ezekiel. Specifying YHWH as per the text is surely an improvement over the generic term, being more precise. And if I'm not mistaken, the Vatican is the major significant party to restrict usage of the Hebrew term among themselves, in favor of non-Hebrew names, for some doctrine of theirs of papal infallibility.  I don't see that as an overriding reason not to use the more specific Hebrew name where it is more appropriate.  However I agree with John that use of the name YHWH for God in Ezekiel can be more fully explained in a section of text.  // ",0,0

Apparently, I'm not the only one who thinks the name of this article matters more than usual.    ::I may be missing some very notable exceptions, as I have not been involved in the dispute until now, but I see no unbiased editors.  I see editors who either support the concept of men's rights or feminists.  That is to say, without belaboring the topic, I see two diametrically opposed ways of viewing the world.  One way says men of every society in every corner of the world developed abusive and patriarchal social structures that oppressed women.  The other way says that gender roles evolved by men and women working together in accordance with biological imperatives like survival.  That these gender roles limited, benefited and oppressed both sexes in different ways by forcing them to conform to the roles that society dictated.  Feminist patriarchy theory has a fundamental need to attach male malice in the way gender relations evolved and inculcate guilt in modern-day males for the supposed sins of their male predecessors.  Tangential rant aside, if we can appreciate that there are two opposing sides here we can achieve a much better and balanced article.  But, instead, what we have on one side are a bunch of feminist editors, armed with all the sources that 30 of feminist dominated academia can churn out disingenuously feigning to be unbiased, disinterested editors who are merely trying to apply WP policy to produce the best article possible.  On the other side, we have the men's rights activists.  ``Men's Rights`` are, essentially, what men's rights activists say they are.  If the article, ``men's rights,`` doesn't have at least 50% of its content from sources that point to ``men rights activists`` (a term that I see used pretty pejoratively on the ``Men's Rights`` talk page) then the article is hopelessly biased.  All feminist sources regarding men's rights are, essentially, sources that respond to the arguments and/or actions of men's rights activists (male or female.)  To base more than 50% of the article on the feminist response to the article's topic is a poor way to write an article.  Such an article can easily occur here if we try to stick to the best WP:RS without including both sides (because we have failed to acknowledge that there are, in fact, two sides here,) as we will end up with an article that amounts to ``Men's Rights according to Feminists.``  The reason for which being that the men's rights activist source may be from some small publisher or self-published but the women's studies text will be published from Oxford Press.  `",0,0

"`    New sub-catagory   I wanted to add something about the “Persian or Farsi” controversy, but first wanted to consult everyone on this. Let’s talk about both, the pros and the cons, and keep it impartial. There are valuable issues raised by renowned Persian scholars. I quote from an article on the same subject:  → Identity Aspect: The word Persian in the mind of an English speaker, consciously or not, recalls many other historical and cultural legacies about Iran. Persian is closely associated with Persian poetry, Persian carpets/rugs, Persian cats, Persian poetry, Persian pistachios, and so on. When you refer to this language as Persian, the audience may associate it with one or more of these relevant ideas. On the contrary, the word Farsi not only voids these historical and cultural associations, but it also adds to the recent portrayal of Iran as a strange and distant society.  → Calling Persian as Farsi, is as incorrect as calling the Persian Gulf as the Farsi Gulf. Moreover, the name Farsi is obscure and under the best conditions refers only to certain dialects such as the Persian of Iran as opposed to Tajiki, the Persian of Tajikistan or Dari, the Persian of Afghanistan, or even one may say Isfahani, the Persian of Isfahan.   → The use of word Farsi in English strikes a discordant tone to the native speaker. Imagine someone speaking in English about their recent trip to Paris saying, ``I went to Paris and there I spoke Francais.`` (Instead of saying French). To use the word Farsi has the same impact and may sound not only pretentious at times but also destructive of English syntax.  We should therefore avoid the use of the word Farsi instead of Persian because it not only violates historical fact but also some of the regularities of the language in which we speak. I believe that Persian is the true and proper name of this language in foreign tongues and international communities and changing it does not benefit the representation of Iranian culture.`",0,0

She has absolutely and completely supported and defended the William Travilla exhibition fraud which we exposed to the public as being a 100% criminal fraud. She edited out the facts on the William Travilla page, added links to her friend's website, which is also a commercial website, Melinda Mason who sold copyright infringed DVD's on eBay.   Next stopthe VANITY FAIR hoax. Delicious Carbuncle started a Wikipedia page for Millington Conroy, after I exposed him for being a forger who fooled the magazine with his fakes.  I am being blocked for telling the truth? Delicious Carbuncle is defaming me on her page, you did not see this?  She claims that her interest is not focused on Marilyn Monroe and or memorabilia? Her edits are telling a different story.  Next the Name of the Rose. She followed me twice now into that one. I was shooting 14 days for this movie and my part was 'Jorge's Novice and that was named after the monks, who most of them did not have a speaking part at all. Pauline Berry aka Delicious Carbuncle aka 'Restawhile'  followed me to Wikipedia (since she has Internet stalked me for the past three yearssince she is financed by none other than Mark Roesler, one of the defendants in the biggest exhibition fraud in history.) I am pointing out the facts here.   She is having a speedy deletion fest and she acts as if she is in charge of running the show. She is not. She cannot turn 100% costume fabrications into original Marilyn Monroe worn costumes, and she tried on her blogs to make sense, because she is part of the project and she is making money off of that fraud.  Now you may think that this edit by Delicious Carbuncle is just 'coincidence' or has nothing to do with Pauline Berry, but until we do not find out who truly is behind Delicious Carbuncle I would ask for fairness in this case and I am asking you to also block this person who has been publicly slandering me, with false accusations, with hypocrite statements and simply with lies.  Now I am aware of the fact that they are working in high numbers, and that it is possible that you, blueboy are part of the group who are supporting a mean and sick fraud project which is out and created solely to defraud the paying public with some foolish fabrications.  Delicious Carbuncle's edit which is a message to Ernest W. Cunningham and Jennifer J. Dickinson.   You be the judge if this is just 'coincidence.'  Please be fair and also block Delicious Carbuncle from further edits.    You, Blueboy96 state this one: 'True or not, attempting to out another user is beyond unacceptable. Indefblocked. Blueboy96'   Did you look at Delicious Carbuncle and realize what this person is doing there?!  This edit was posted on Delicious Carbuncle's site and once she realized that she gave herself away, she edited over it, yet I saved it on time.  You have to know that I called up Mrs. Pauline Berry in order to ask her to stop stalking me and to stop supporting one fraud after another. She is a 45 year old musician who also does try Marilyn Monroe imitations from time to time. She asked me years ago for my opinion as an expert on some Marilyn Monroe autographs and I gave he my honest opinion and told her right away that the signed photographs she claimed to have purchased were 100% fakes. She did not take that too well and ever since she is referring to me a 'self proclaimed expert,' she has spent years now on her hateful postings, websites filled with character assassination attempts, comparing me to murderers Charles Manson and John Lennon killer Mark Chapman. Pauline Berry is supporting people who used AIDS infected blood within their intimidation emails and threats. Who threatened to come to my home and burglarize me, harm me, tie me onto a chair and steal my collection. Pauline Berry has been a big part on the public defamation on three people.  Please read the edits of Delicious Carbuncle and see the message. She is referring to my calls to her home, when I attempted to find out why she is supporting criminals.  Who else would this be, instead of Pauline Berry, since only she knew at the time, that I actually called?!      * (hist) (diff) User talk:64.236.80.62‎ (Caution: Vandalism on Peaches Geldof.)

"`Regarding your speedy deletion of my article The Resonance Project  I'm unfamiliar with this interface so hopefully this is the proper ``talk`` process.    I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's ``flat-earth society`` type behaviour that I find objectionable.  I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called ``community``.  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the ``Speedy Deletion`` I could find no such option.  When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for ``Nassim Haramein`` and ``The Resonance Project`` in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-``free`` encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.  This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

While I am sure some degree of comparison is very useful, if not necessary, I don't think that going to great lengts to explain what common law is and then just say ``and civil law is not like this`` is a very good way of defining civil law.  The 4th paragraph in the intro (the largest one) is the main culprit here. In fact the third sentence in it doesn't even follow on properly from the first two and should logically read pretty much the opposite of what it does. In addition it seems to be be very US-centric: while it mentions English Common Law, it then goes on to list examples of basic tenets of this which seem to be drawn directly from the US Constitution.  So I think it's pretty badly written as an introduction, but as I don't know too much about the subject I don't really want to go about editing it myself.`",0,0

Although repeatedly reverting or undoing another editor's contributions may seem necessary to protect your preferred version of a page, on Wikipedia this is usually seen as obstructing the normal editing process, and often creates animosity between editors. Instead of edit warring, please discuss the situation with the editor(s) involved and try to reach a consensus on the talk page.  If editors continue to revert to their preferred version they are likely to be blocked from editing. This isn't done to punish an editor, but to prevent the disruption caused by edit warring. In particular, editors should be aware of the three-revert rule, which says that an editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page within a 24-hour period. While edit warring on Wikipedia is not acceptable in any amount, breaking the three-revert rule is very likely to lead to a block.

That was my first Wikipedia account (I was 11 year old when I first used that account in 2009, and 14 when i lasted used it in 2012). I'm 17 years old now.  I remember when I would used to create a lot of articles, notably on actors who starred in shows that I watched (wizards of waverly place, hannah montana, etc.) We first crossed paths in 2009 (and parted ways in 2012, looking at your last edit on that account userpage), when you nominated a good number of them for deletion (some of them got deleted). If you look at the talk page on the GreenBayPackers account, you'll notice that I actually got vindicated on a good number of the articles you nominated for deletion – a lot of the articles are intact, and in fact have been expanded with pictures, more sources, etc. such as the Harry Shum and Simon Curtis article. I forgot the password to that account, and later used sockpuppets (which I remember you blocked me for, lol). So, how have you been? I've been well. I've started editing a broad multitude of articles productively (I'd argue I was editing productively with that other account as well, and that you were being a tad overzealous). I now edit articles on current events, public figures, politicians, etc. I've learned a lot about Wikipedia's rules, and have made a good number of productive edits.

The book states; The discrepencies in eyewitnesses evidence were substancial and wide-ranging. Each of the fourteen eyewitnesses testified different accounts of what they saw. Some eyewitnesses testified seeing Ryan to the East of Hodson and some eyewitnesses testified seeing Ryan to the West of Hodson.

More significantly, only FOUR eyewitnesses testified actually seeing Ryan fire a shot. The was no contest that the evidence of each eyewitness were very contradictory. Purrum's infamous book goes on to describe the discrepencies in the prosecution's case, eg. the lack of scientific forensic evidence, the vital missing pieces of evidence, the downward trajectory angle of the fatal bullet, and prison officer Paterson testifying he fired the single shot that was heard by all eyewitnesses.

There was nothing particularly interesting/controversial about Chaplin's cause of death. The infobox does mention that he died aged 88, so most people probably already understand from that that he died of 'old age'.

No personal attacks from me either, only observation of your misdeeds and mass-scale bad faith reverts. Also you defined the editor who TOC'd the cat as an ``SPA``, but WP:SPA and Arbcoms specific def. on an SPA does not support your statement, so perhaps that's another example of your hostility towards IPs and new editors.

"`== Old talk == Please, do not add Computer RPGs here - they are already listed in Computer Role Playing Games article.       26/7/2001 Should the games listing come out of the main page and instead go to somewhere like RPG/RPG Listings? :Well, there are also listings in the subgenre articles, so I think we should merge them.  07:28 Jan 16, 2003 (UTC)   I think the more useful distinction is between Role-playing games and Role-playing generally. I'm taking the latter from this page and making a new page just for the more general case.  Also note that I use ``role-playing`` as the generic term more commonly linked to psychological uses because it is so cited in Webster's New World College Dictionary. Moreover, I am adopting the ``role-playing game`` usage (hyphen between role and playing) in order to follow that convention and because it makes sense grammatically (hyphenate compound adjectives modifying a noun).   However I am thinking that ``role-play game`` follows common usage better than ``role-playing game.`` But I'm not going to redirect the page now, anyway (Dec. 26, 2001)     :No one I know of (and I know lots of gamers) says ``role-play game``.  It's always ``role-playing game``, and I am sure that's the most common usage.       Not to sound like a nerd or anything, but White Wolf is not, strictly speaking, a role-playing game. They are a publisher. Their role-playing game universe, World of Darkness, encompasses between 5 and 12 or so (depending on how you count them) role-playing games... OK. I'm really not that much of a nerd... OK. Maybe just a bit.  10:39 Dec 6, 2002 (UTC)  :I added the ``Notable RPG Developers and Publishers`` heading for links to companies (and maybe individual creators).  16:15 Dec 6, 2002 (UTC)   Isn't Battletech more a table-top war game and not an RPG? I have never played it, but isn't there Mechwarrior, which is an RPG based on Battletech's world?  07:24 Jan 16, 2003 (UTC)  Battletech was purely wargame, then Mechwarrior was made to turn it into an RPG, however they are basically the same thing, Mechwarrior is like AD&Ds; Player Handbook and BattleTech rules are simply the rules for combat, battletech being more complex than AD&D.; Battletech is notable from other RPGs in that correctly played one's character is as mortal as all the enemies one fights, so usually you die. Its basically a wargame where the units have stats which change over the course of a campaign, and most people generally have the commander of their forces represent themselves, thus, an RPG and a wargame. Also its common for the GM or DM to be replaced by a classical referee and then the players, instead of playing as a team, go to war with each other.   - Battletech was a miniatures game, based on Japanese anime, in the ``mech``  genre. Later a set of rules was developed that allowed one to play a mech pilot in an ongoing campaign. Battletech was published FASA, which is now out of business. Along with Battletech FASA also published games such as ``Behind Enemy Lines`` (World War Two skirmish game), ``Shadowrun`` (cyberpunk/'magic returns' roleplaying), and ``Earthdawn`` (fantasy roleplaying). At present both Battletech and Earthdawn have found new publishers.  For a list of RPGs I recommend trying the Yahoo and Google directories You will find listings for literally hundreds of games. Have fun.  Finally, when I have it composed I will be uploading an essay on roleplaying games, and why they really aren't games at all. At least not in the traditional sense of a game as something with victory conditions and competition among the participants.  Hope this finds you all well. 15:14 Feb 9, 2003 (UTC)  :Sounds interesting, but remember that Wikipedia tries to maintain a neutral point of view.  It may be better to simply provide a link to your essay.   15:43 Feb 9, 2003 (UTC)  - Merriam-Webster's definition of game includes as its first entry activity engaged in for diversion or amusement and then equates it with play.  Dictionary.com defines, again as the first entry, a game as being an activity providing entertainment or amusement.

"`HP's 2008 memristor paper in Nature used M(q)=ROFF(1-mvRON/D^2 q) where ROFF, RON are the off and on resistances, mv is the ionic mobility of oxygen vacancies, D is the film thickness and q is charge.   Regarding the more general idea beyond magnetic flux this is usually associated with Chua and Kang's 1976 paper on memristive systems which used a dynamic systems definition rather then the ``fourth fundamental circuit element`` memristor definition. In reality most real materials exhibiting memristive effects obey the 1976 dynamic system definition but have nothing to do with the 1971 magnetic flux definition. My opinion is that HP has used the 1971 definition more for marketing purposes then for any real technical merit.   Regarding negative memristance, one of the proven mathematical properties of memristive systems is that they are passive and do not produce energy. Thus if there are devices having some properties similar to a memristor but which produce (or amplify) energy it would not be formally describable as a memristor or a memristive system. This is one reason why it is unlikely for memristors to replace transistors since they are incapable of performing signal amplification on their own.    `",0,0

He was confirmed in his authority by Mughal Emperor Hulagu, of whom he was a vassal, and greatly increased his power and authority in the reign of his succesor, Abaka Khan.  Shamsuddin was succeeded by his son Ruknuddin, at his capital, Herat, Afghanistan. Ruknuddin took Kandahar, Afghanistan, and died in the reign of Sultan Arghun Khan, around 1280 A.D. His brother, Ghiasuddin Malik Kurd, then succeeded, and was confirmed by the Mughal Emperor Aljaitu Khan in his command of Ghor to the confines of the provinces on the Indus river in Pakistan.  The Malik Kurd dynasty was extinguished around 1380 A.D., when Amir Timur (Tamerlane) took Herat, and slew its last prince and his son.

BTW: are you wise and omniscient ones (sarcasm) aware that Federal reserve notes were not legal tender until 1933?  lets see if you read it here   I believe that Congress does NOT have the power to make paper money a legal tender and does not even have the power to make gold and silver a legal tender.The reference below show clearly that at least one US president and Funding Father agree with me on both counts and that at least two US presidents, and Founding Fathers agree with me on one count.  I hope that claims of original research and synthesis can now be put to rest as BOGUS.   An old NY times article http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res;=9501E2DB133BEE33A25751C1A9669D94679ED7CF references the following quotes  James Madison  - Thus the pretext for a paper currency and particularly for making the bill a legal tender, either for public or private debt, was cut off  Thomas Jefferson - I now deny their (Congress's) power of making paper money, or anything else, a legal tender  A Mr Benton who is also cited, states: The power granted to Congress to coin money is an authority to stamp metallic money, and is not an authority for emitting slips of paper containing promises to pay money.  Per Yale Law School records of the minutes of the vote to TAKE AWAY from Congress the power to ``emit bills of credit`` during the Constitutional Convention as recorded by Founding Father and future president James Madison  http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_816.asp    FN23 This vote in the affirmative by Virga. was occasioned by the acquiescence of Mr. Madison who became satisfied that striking out the words would not disable the Govt. from the use of public notes as far as they could be safe & proper; & would only cut off the pretext for a paper currency, [FN24] and particularly for making the bills a tender [FN24] either for public or private debts.    and   ``Mr. Ghorum was for striking out, without inserting any prohibition. if the words stand they may suggest and lead to the measure.``   My aside: The power to be struck out was the power to ``emit``. Mr. Ghorum, (Madison misspelled the name - the person is actually Nathanial Gorham) states that if the words stand (the words being ``emit bills of credit``) that ``they may suggest and lead to the measure`` with the measure being printing legal tender paper money. To be ABSOLUTELY clear, this vote denied Congress the power to ``emit`` per money, and strikes at the core of arguments in favor of paper money, because Congress cannot make paper money a legal tender because the power to print paper money was REMOVED from Congress. If Congress cannot even print paper money, how can it make it legal tender?  In Federalist 44 - Madison states    The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which America has sustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man, on the necessary confidence in the public councils, on the industry and morals of the people, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an enormous debt against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure, which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice, of the power which has been the instrument of it.   From Craig v Misouri   The whole was intended to exclude everything from use as a circulating medium except gold and silver''', and to give to the United States the exclusive control over the coining and valuing of the metallic medium. That the real dollar may represent property, and not the shadow of it.   From the dissenting opinion to one of the Legal Tender cases http://supreme.justia.com/us/79/457/case.html - starts with THE CHIEF JUSTICE, dissenting'  Acts of Congress not made in pursuance of the Constitution are not laws.  We perceive no connection between the express power to coin money and the inference that the government may, in any contingency, make its securities perform the functions of coined money, as a legal tender in payment of debts  It is unnecessary to say that we reject wholly the doctrine, advanced for the first time",0,0

The vast majority of images on the internet are not acceptable to use on Wikipedia.  Because one of the goals of the project is to encourage the creation of free content, we do not accept photos of living people under a claim of ``fair use``.  Unless you, personally, held your camera in your hand and took the picture, it is probably not appropriate to upload.  If you have a friend who took a photo that you want to use or if you want to contact someone on Flickr or some other website and ask for permission, Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission has an article on doing so and Wikipedia:Declaration of consent for all enquiries explains the type of permission we need.  Essentially, we need for the copyright holder (the person who snapped the photo with the camera) to agree to a license that permits anyone to use the photo for any reason, provided that they give proper credit.  Sometimes this means that we simply don't have a photo at all of someone or that we have a lesser quality photo, but it is considered important toward Wikipedia's goal of a free content encyclopedia.   `",0,0

Ample evidence of wrong doing has been provided, maybe not with respect to the BI sanction (but even that is not clear cut, given it is meant to be broadly construed), but definitely in the sense that these edits are clearly the same terminology policing behaviour that led to that sanction, but on a slightly different BI related term. Action is clearly warranted. Archived or not, as I said, I am not going to let this lie, I will be informing Cailil when he returns. In addition to sanctioning Highking, I expect he will want to take issue with you disrespecting him by completely ignoring all the effort he went to in detailing exactly what is wrong with HighKing's behaviour, and what he should be avoiding. Who I am is completely and utterly irrelevant to whether or not HighKing is ignoring those warnings and engaging in the beahviour Cailil described as being not wanted here. He even made that exact point to HighKing - while Cailil has sympathy with the so called harassment he often claims to be suffering as a way of avoiding sanctions for making these edits, Cailil was crystal clear on the point that who reports him, or even just the mere presence of suspect accounts in any of these reports/disputes, has absolutely no bearing on whether or not he will act on any poor behaviour he observes from HighKing. I know he has previously expressed frustration at seemingly being the only admin here who is prepared to deal with HighKing, and I can see why with actions like this. Your closure of the section simply because of who the complainents are has only one effect - rewarding HighKing for bad edits. It's really no skin off my nose, is it? If I am a banned user, do you think archiving that discussion will have any effect on me? Or if I am not banned but this is just not my main account, then do you think archiving the section is going to change whatever reason I might have for not posting there with my main account? Of course not. The only thing it achieves is to remove from sight as an immediate issue. Which, given the fact Cailil was at pains to point out that HighKing's poor behaviour stretches back to 2008, is not a good thing for Wikipedia. You're an admin. You're expected to deal with long term problems, not sweep them under the carpet for wholly irrelevant reasons. If HighKing were ever to end up at arbitration for example, do you think he would escape sanction for persistent WP:TE behaviour, simply because other people involved were not following some completely unrelated rule like WP:SOCK? Of course not. Hopefully you can at least appreciate that as an admin, you being the person who maintains that cycle of WP:TE, is not only bad for Wikipedia, it's a form of laxity that really isn't excused by who I may or may not be. It also had the material effect of me not being able to correct Murray on a basic point of fact, meaning the archive now has errors in it, which I am sure is not the intent of that facility. Archive or no archive, at the very least, if, or more likely when, Cailil sanctions HighKing for those edits, I expect you to hold your hands up and admit your failure to do your duty as an admin in this case. Anything less will simply fall well below the expected standards of admins on Wikipedia. Anyway, I've probably spent far too long typing a post that you will most likely just ignore and delete, so goodbye for now.   ",1,0

But then again, all the Final Fantasies to come to America in that period of time had to go through Nintendo of America's censorship guidelines of the time.  *It might be worth noting (at least in the discussion) that the computer version was far more censored than the PSX version. Almost every instance of ``shit`` was removed, consistently with #^$& or similar characters. Also, certain important lines had their translations changed. ``Back then, you could get by with only skinned knees``, for example, was changed to something likely more grammatically correct, but weird to a long time player of the PSX version.    I have the PC version of FF7 and I recall a TON of Cid lines where there was censorship as well as ones form Barret. They were all situations of anger though so it didn't impact the storyline much.  Actually''' there was some sexual censorship if I recall. ``Slightly stretched underwear`` was changed to ``Therapeutic underwear.`` Not sure why it's better, but I'm pretty sure they did it because they thought ``slightly stretched`` was sexually inappropriate.

Children are required to attend school from 6 to 18 in Belgium and 5 to 18 in The Netherlands or until they attain a specific level of education (BE: any secondary education, NL: HAVO, VWO or a level 2 MBO). See Dutch government website on 'leerplicht' and Flemish regional government's page on the same subject. Not relevant for Hogeschool, but faulty info in the article nontheless.  Dutch MBO is not considered school for the first two years, it is always considered school (unlike a ``Hogeschool``, that functions as a University in terms of application, funding etc).   Now I don't know exactly how the Flemish equivalent of Hogeschool/High-school is used, but i'll sum up how it works in the Netherlands from the lowest level up until Hogeschool (usually translated as ``University of Applied Sciences``). I'll skip internal stuff on VMBO and MBO, basically VMBO level determines MBO starting leve and you can always go up a MBO level(1-4) if you want to spend the time.  MBO level 4 provides access to almost all(1) Hogeschool Associate (120 ECTS) and Bachelor (240 ECTS) programs. Associate degrees are more of a technicality, unknown to employers and unused in most programs, but they exist. Completing the first year (also known as Propedeuse) of a Hogeschool program grants access to almost all(1) University Bachelor programs.  1)Additional requirements may be set, usually involving math or language courses attended.  Hogescholen (and Universities) must offer access to their Associate and Bachelor programs to potential students aged 21 and up via 'Colloquium Doctum'. Here's some more info from a Dutch University in English on that subject, including a reference to the article of Dutch law about 'Colloquium Doctum'. The same system is often used when potential students lack certain courses from previous studies.  Regarding the article as a whole, it seems to lack sources overall, I feel it should be open for editing or otherwise overhauled to apply only to the term ``high school`` and it's literal translations, redirecting to articles about secondary/higher education if needed.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by      == Is high school in comics a valid category? About half of super hero's are teenagers. ==  I think this is as valid a category as zoos in fiction; these are both settings that are only really told by specific kind of stories. Teen and animal adventure.     ::Category:Fictional schools and its subcategory Category:Superhero schools already exist.    : :Teenaged superheros are not fictional schools. They might be fictional high school students and or fictional teenagers. In many cases, however, those will not be defining characteristics. - [[User:SummerPhD|Summer",0,0
What is interesting and should be noted - if indeed such a quote attributed to Churchill is included in the article - is that the Armenian community entirely rejected this call for rebellion - there was no rebellion - there were no actions taken to assit the British by undermining Ottoman authority (though there doies exist Turkish propoganda claiming such...of course with no particulars given - nor did Armenians of the Empire have any actual means to incite a rebellion if indeed they ever had wanted to.   ,0,0

Evidence was produced by other users to show that he LIED when he said that he did just a simple copy-editing, as it was shown that he deleted sentences, and that he distorted the meaning of other phrases, simply because he has no clue about the Inclusive Democracy project.Despite all this, he comes back again and again adding/deleting and ``re-organizing`` at will this entry.

Yes, it's true that some editors were essentially making the ``let the WikiProject decide`` argument, and that's a junk argument. You may be familiar with WikiProject Birds' insistence on title-case capitalization for bird articles, which I oppose, or at least gripe about, at any opportunity. But the opposers were not the only ones making junk arguments. The accusations of sexism were uncalled for there, and some of the name-calling thereof was really beneath the standards of dialogue we ought to aim for. Furthermore, it's simply not true to say that there is no policy-based rationale for opposing the request. PRIMARYTOPIC is a plenty legitimate reason, which to a certain extent overrides PRECISE and certainly doesn't inherently contradict NPOV. And I really don't understand your appeal to V. In the discussion, you mentioned that it's ``verifiable`` that there are men's and women's teams, but that seemed a quintessentially straw man argument. Literally no one was arguing that there is no women's team. :Look, I'm probably more sympathetic to your overall argument than the oppose voters. If I were against the move on the merits, I would've voted instead of closing. But there's a larger conversation that needs to happen here. Wikipedia follows usage in other sources, so is systemic bias ok if present in those sources? I don't think there's a right or easy answer to that question. Where we have articles on a country's men's and women's teams, I wouldn't be upset to see a broader decision that they should be named explicitly, perhaps with a dab at the base title. At the same time, I'm not sure I would participate in that discussion. There were junk arguments on both sides of this RM, but there were also some very good ones on both sides. That's no consensus.   `",0,0

"`  ==Test== Candid Camera: Australian Photography 1950s–1970s was a group retrospective exhibition of social documentary photography held at the Art Gallery of South Australia from 28 May to 1 August 2010.Art Gallery of South Australia Exhibitions Candid Camera website  Candid Camera had its roots in Six Photographers, a groundbreaking exhibition held in Sydney in May 1955, which concentrated on what was still a relatively new development in Australian photography and featured the work of Max Dupain, David Potts, Axel Poignant, Gordon Andrews, Kerry Dundas and Hal Missingham.Robinson, Julie ``Candid Camera: Australian Photography 1950s–1970s`` Art Gallery of South Australia exhibition catalogMcDonald, Patrick ``The Way We Were`` The Advertiser, 20 May 2010 AdelaideNow websiteNewton, Gael ``Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988`` Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055) The work of the first three of these artists is also represented in Candid Camera. Six Photographers, an artist-initiated show that featured 200 images at a time when exhibitions of personal photographic work were rare, was regarded as sufficiently influential for the Art Gallery of New South Wales to commemorate it with a show of the same name featuring the same six photographers, more than 50 years after it had first been presented.Newton, Gael ``Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988`` Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055)Newton, Gael ``Silver And Grey: Fifty Years Of Australian Photography 1900-1950`` Angus & Robertson, 1980 (ISBN 0207141096)Art Gallery of New South Wales Exhibitions Archive AGNSW websiteAllen, Christopher ``Decisive Moments``, The Australian, 27 February 2010 The Australian website This second version of Six Photographers featured 29 images, many of them shown in 1955, and concentrated on works from the same period (the late forties through to the mid-fifties).  Candid Camera, while about half the size of the 1955 Sydney exhibition, covered a significantly wider range of artists and looks not just at the foundations of Australian social documentary photography but at the era that curator Julie Robinson clearly regards as its golden age – the fifties, sixties and seventies.  In line with the statements issued by the six photographers group, Candid Camera featured “images which appear unposed, spontaneous, or with their subjects captured unaware”. Though the majority of the photos in the exhibition (more than 80 in total) were taken in Australia, images by Australian photographers working overseas were also included.Allen, Christopher ``Unguarded Moments``, The Australian, 17 July 2010 The Australian websiteEmmett, Patrick ``Candid Camera`` ABC Television interview, originally broadcast on Stateline, 28 May 2010 ABC website Subjects included youth subcultures, newly arrived migrants, nuns, a number of prime ministers (though not all were in office at the time of the photo), musicians such as Bon Scott of AC/DC, and ordinary people in everyday settings: at work, at the beach and at bus stops.  Photographers represented in Candid Camera included Max Dupain, David Moore, Jeff Carter, Max Pam, Robert McFarlane, Mervyn Bishop, Rennie Ellis, Carol Jerrems and Roger Scott and a number of others. Of those named, all have work held in the permanent collection of National Gallery Of Australia. Mervyn Bishop is the only Aboriginal Australian to have been included, and though his work has primarily been in New South Wales, Robert McFarlane was the only photographer to be born in South Australia. In this last regard, Candid Camera was very different to Century In Focus, an earlier large-scale photographic survey curated by Robinson, which dealt only with images taken in South Australia.Robinson, Julie ``A Century in Focus: South Australian Photography 1840s-1940s`` AGSA/Thames & Hudson. 2007 (ISBN 9780730830702)  The exhibition and catalog both identified a number of different strands within Australian social documentary photography after the first generation – new photojournalism in the sixties, and the more personal approaches taken in the seventies – along with a number of themes in the subject matter: everyday life, the protest movements of the sixties, street photography and Australia’s increasing engagement with Asia.  Though Robert McFarlane, formerly photographic critic on the Sydney Morning Herald and one of the photographers included in the exhibition, agrees that the exhibition’s time frame was ``the great period of photo-journalism internationally,`` he also believes that ``the importance of documentary photography has never been greater, because Australia is changing dramatically in terms of its work habits and its racial make-up, and politically it is changing as well.`` In this, he echoes the original six photographers and their statement ``Our manners, mode of living and appearance are changing more rapidly from year to year, and we feel the camera can and should be used to record this constant flux.``Six Photographers, exhibition catalog (Sydney 1955)  Candid Camera was accompanied by a series of talks, a program of Australian films from the same era, and screenings of Girl In A Mirror, a Rose d’Or winning documentary about Carol Jerrems, who died in 1980 at the age of 30.Art Gallery of South Australia Media Release AGSA websiteZiffer, Daniel ``ABC Shows Bask In Glory`` The Age, 1 May 2006 The Age website   == Notes == `",0,0

Psychics are not scientists, and scientific methodology can't be used on the phenomenon (for the most part).  The Seth Material has more to do with religion and philosophy than anything else.

It seems silly to arbitrarily select a source for the chart order, expecially when there are concerns noted above over the site being a reliable source.  As you can see I've been working through the films adding reliable sources from places like The New York Times, Variety etc, so there is now better sourced information to rank the films from.    Given the nature of budget estimates, they often differ from source to source and that has to be taken into account.  I'm against arbitrarily 'picking' a source to rank by.  I am also against the idea of averaging the amounts given by the sources or picking the most frequently cited amount, since this system would be open to manipulation by adding more sources.  My solution would be to rank using the lowest common denominator; case in point:  some sources say GI Joe cost $170m, and some $175m, but while the figures don't match they both agree that the film cost at least $170m.  In view of that, my suggestion would be to rank off the lower amount, but include the higher amount as an alternative estimate.  In the case of films where we have an official figure I'm of the opinion that the films should always be ranked by the official budget with any further estimates included as an alternative estimate.  I'll hopefully finish sourcing the remaining films on the chart over the next week and will then implement the new chart structure if no-one has any objections.   ",0,0

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.  Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.  I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.  I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of: 1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality). 2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a ``mum`` insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree. 3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking ``research`` from questionable sources and only ever ``research`` or accept sources that back up their own beliefs. 4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have ``won`` the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on. 5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times. 6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)  Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.  Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

"`  THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:   Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,  You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.  May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.  There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of ``shame`` and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.  The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.  It is totally UNACCEP LE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on ``North Nicosia`` that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.   This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.   In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an ``encyclopedic`` project that is totally biased and discriminatory.  Marcobadotti (talk) `",1,1

Using it to describe a cat seems redundant (``she's a minx`` means something like ``she's catty,`` I thought  ``a minx`` is some sort of fighting feline).   The Hillman Minx car, in the 1950's, was a very small automobile (smaller than a Volkswagen beetle) its name probably meant to suggest that it was sprightly and energetic despite its tiny size and low power (I only know of it that our family owned two of them  a grey one with yellow ear-flaps, and later a red one  the Minx could not go fast, so its driver had to outwit other cars rather than overtaking them...).

"You are talking nonsense again. The reconstructed pronunciation is not a modern theory nor has it been substantiated by modern linguists. Repeating the same old 19th century out of date fallacies in a modern book does not constitute evidence or substantiation. The only differnece between modern linguists repitition of these fallacies and the original is that the modern linguists have removed all of the racist slurs from the original work (well most of them anyway) and have included the disclaimer that none of the nonsense they are regurgitating is provable given the historical evidence, or rather the complete lack of it, and modern research which is unanimously against the theory. Thanos Papadimitrakopulos publication is a perfectly valid source since it postdates the standard form of the reconstructed pronunciation that is still taught today (a theory that is never substantiated to students but is taught as unproven dogma) and he has never been refuted. Chrys C. Caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source. Development of Greek and the New Testament, Mohr Siebeck (ISBN 3161482905) is his most recent publication a probable the most recent research on ancient Greek pronunciation in existence. Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone.

"`I've studied neurology basics, and it is difficult for me to decide which one, perhaps it is micture of both, un and sub consciousness. Let me point to the typical as I think mode of tailgaters (I only guess because I am not one) so called ``autopilot`` when one switch off and focus only on the stop light of the car in front. This can be observed in cases when locked on to the tailgating mode, all other lanes are free to move and drive faster even within limit and surely free of obstacle of slower cars in front, but those drivers on autopilot persist and do not notice of the opportunity to change lane. Often they do tailgate for a long distance without changing lane which is free for some time and only when you decide to do so or come from behind, they come suddenly in front of you. This is partially subconscious. Our peripheral vision is sensitive to movement, their brain register this, they immediately notice that the object they notices (you) moves on or into free lane, they make immediately reactive rather than fully conscious and rational decision and they move dangerously in front of you. I believe that if they drove not on autopilot, they would long before you decided and changed lane. I believe that such sub/un counscious behavior is a result of poor driver training. Proper training enable much better and counsious decisions and faster.  `",0,0

"`::::Your statements in this section have suggested that an Orthodox Jew who doesn't strictly follow Orthodox halakha is a Conservative Jew, and that a Conservative Jew who doesn't strictly follow Conservative halakha is a Reform Jew. That's simply not the case. Every religion has a normative set of rules, and some people don't follow them. Conservative Judaism isn't a movement for lapsed Orthodox Jews, and Reform Judaism isn't a movement for lapsed Conservative Jews. These movements are not distinguished by different degrees of observance of Orthodox law; they each have their own philosophy of Judaism and how it should be practiced.   ::::Conservative Judaism has a ``strict`` halakha that it believes is a continuation of the rabbinic tradition. It expects Conservative Jews to follow that law. The fact that many Conservative Jews don't follow the movement's halakha may be notable, but it doesn't mean that Conservative Judaism has no halakha.  ::::You ask if ``all facets of CJ today claim to be working in the continuation of Rabbinic proccess or not?`` I don't know what you mean by ``all facets`` — are you referring to members of the Rabbinical Assembly or individual Conservative Jews? I don't know that every member of the Rabbinical Assembly is in agreement, but the Conservative movement's view is that it is continuing the historical process of rabbinic interpretation and halakhic evolution that has been going on for more than 2000 years.  ::::Are there ``some elements`` within the Conservative rabbinate who don't strictly follow the decisions of the RA? Absolutely. I'm sure that there were Conservative rabbis who were officiating at civil unions before the movement said it was okay. I was too young to know, but I imagine that some Conservative synagogues may have included women in a minyan before the RA said it was alright. And there may be Conservative synagogues that won't include women even if the RA says that they must. I don't know, but I think that they believe that they are acting within the rabbinic tradition. I doubt that any of them is saying ``Halakha be damned, I'm going to do whatever I want.``  ::::Yes, the Conservative movement ``by its nature expands the boundaries of their interpetation of the law.`` It calls it ``evolution,`` and it makes no secret of it. Its viewpoint is that Akiva and Hillel and Rambam and every other rabbi in Jewish history has done the same thing — until the reactionary Orthodox movement slowed the process to a snail's pace.  ::::Anyway, I think this discussion is going way off track. I'm sorry for the tone of my earlier comments, but saying that Conservative Jews are lapsed Orthodox is offensive. —   |    ::::PS: Regarding Wolpe and his views of the Exodus, that's so far afield that I hope you don't mind if I leave my comments on your Talk page.  `",0,0

"` Note: I've put the debate at Talk:Yttrium in the next section so that lazy editors don't  have to click the link to see what he is talking about.  [edit] Periodic group Surely the group 3 elements are Sc, Y , La, Ac? NOT Lu!! See, for example, long-form periodic table. Petergans (talk)   Both conventions are common and are often a source of debate. The group 3 element article tries to explain the story. Itub (talk)   Common? I've never seen it. Lu is a lanthanide in all the standard inorganic texts, Greenwood & Earnshaw, Cotton & Wilkinson, Housecroft & Sharpe, Shriver & Atkins ... The debate was concluded long ago. Petergans (talk)   Just last month there was an article published in J. Chem. Ed. continuing the debate (advocating La and Ac in group 3), and it cites a few books and articles that follow the opposite convention. See [1]. There are also four letters about this topic in the same issue.[2] Itub (talk)   Unbelievable! In 50 years as a chemist I have never, until yesterday, seen a periodic table with Lu anywhere other than in the lanthanide series. Web elements is a first for me and, as far as I'm concerned, just another example of nonsense on the web. IUPAC puts La under Y. There is no ambiguity about it, just that the lanthanide series convertionally starts with La and is usually written separately. Petergans (talk)   This is not nonsense on the Web. There have been many textbooks published since the 1980s that put Lu under Y (I can't say whether they are the majority or the most influential). Just one example: Wulfsberg's Inorganic Chemistry. Wulfberg explains his reasoning in a footnote. In this letter to JCE, the authors looked at 35 textbooks for what they call ``flyleaf periodic tables``. If you look at the figure in the letter, among the textbooks published since 1984, 7 put La under Y, 7 put Lu, and 2 put all 15 lanthanides like IUPAC. IUPAC's table is ambiguous. It doesn't put any specific element under Y; it puts all the lanthanides there! Itub (talk)   I'm flabbergasted. I thought elements were put in the same group because they have the same electronic configuration. The trivalent ions of Sc, Y, La, Ac have a noble gas electronic configuration. Lu(III) does not. How can it be put in the same group? (Don't answer that). I stand by the word nonsense!Petergans (talk)   I'll dare to answer despite your request. I'm relatively neutral on this issue because I think it is largely an arbitrary convention, but I enjoy playing devil's advocate. 1) the periodic table predates knowledge of electronic configurations, and sometimes exceptions are made in the name of chemical properties (or even in the name of layout, in my opinion), such as putting helium above neon instead of above beryllium (although some tables do put He above Be!) 2) the relationship between the electronic configurations of Y and La is essentially the same as the one between Al and Ga: Al and Ga are both s2p1, but Ga has a full d shell that Al doesn't have; Y and Lu are both s2d1, but Lu has a full f shell that Y doesn't have. Trivalent Lu also has a noble gas configuration, in the sense of having no s and p electron in the valence shell, same as trivalent gallium. 3) if one looks at the neutral atom, La has the same configuration as Y, but that's an anomaly in that it doesn't follow the aufbau rule. But we don't move elements such as copper and palladium to another group just because they happen to deviate from aufbau. Finally, one slight disadvantage of putting La under Y is that you end up with a discontinuous d block in the long form of the periodic table, which looks a bit odd in my opinion. Itub (talk)   (no indent) The counter to that argument is that, in the spirit of Mendeleev, elements a grouped together because of similarities in chemistry. Therefore it is the electronic configuration in the ``group oxidation state`` that counts, not the configuration of the atoms. Cu is the classic example [Ar]4s13d10 in the atom, but in Cu(I) the relative energies of 4s and 3d are reversed and it is the s electron which is lost on oxidation of the metal, so Cu sits comfortably in a group with Ag and Au. For Au, the f electrons are discounted as they belong to the filled 4-shell comprising 4s, 4p, 4d and 4f.  We can argue this one for ever, but what concerns me now is that the basic image of the long-form periodic table, which is used in WP for all the elements, puts Sc and Y above Lu and presents La and Ac as a group on their own. I believe that this is misleading as it does not clearly distinguish the lanthanide and actinide series from the main-group elements and transition metals. long-form periodic ",0,0

As for the controversy section, it's hard to expand because often what we have are the quotes - nothing more or less - and I can't really work them into to the main article for the same reasons as with the trivia section.

"  == Suggested clarifications ==  I think Gilles objection to using ports as classification is that it may be confused with the number of valves promoted by post petrol engine manufactures. I suggest usine 'Dual cycle' instead of 'four port' and 'Single cycle' instead of 'two port'.  The avec chariots ans sans chariots designs could be used in either layout. The AC would be better suited to an internal combution engine but would also suit say an gas pump or expander, due to the greater change in volume through the cycle.   The possible use as an internal combustion engine has recieved the most attention. It has many more uses - pneumatic motor, steam engine, refrigerant expander, pump etc. As far as I can see development is currently focused on the 'dual cycle', which is better suited to the majority of these uses, so perhaps the 'internal comustion engine' should be presented as a simply possible use of the single cycle configuration.  Photo-detonation/HCCI/SCCI/ATAC really warrant a seperate page with a mention here that the Quasiturbine is better suited to it than current engine designs due to the quick compression rate at 'tdc'  It is theoretically possible to use different fluids in the pump, as long as cross-contamination is not a problem. You could use hydrolic oil to pump air, as long as it doesn't matter if your compressed air is full of hydrolic oil! The fact the rotor is exposed to both 'cycles', there will be a layer or oil on the face plate when it is on the 'air' side. Seals and tolerances would also have to be right for the 'thinner' fluid, meaning an increase in friction compared to puming a thicker fluid. There isn't any evidence this has been tested, however.

"  == Type 1 - missing the point ==   Due to the general requirement of the use of some social engineering in this case (and normally in Type 0 vulnerabilities as well), many programmers have disregarded these holes as not terribly important. This misconception is sometimes applied to XSS holes in general (even though this is only one type of XSS) and there is often disagreement in the security community as to the importance of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.  This section misses the entire point. If I wanted to grab cookies from users using some form of local JavaScript exploit (just an example, there are hundreds of other things possible), I could use a type 1 vulnerability on a forum or popular website in order to attack the maximum number of users. The social engineering side of it is therefore a side-note, as it only applies when an attacker is targeting one specific user - and even then if they know they frequent that site they don't have to social engineer them at all.

While mildly interesting, it's hard to argue that it increases the value of the Pink Floyd article itself, as few people who read the article will be searching it out for information on Pink Floyd tattoos. :#Much content on the site is commerical, marketing T-shirts and the like. This is clear in the discography, which holds no information other than a simple list of the albums (available on Wikipedia itself anyway) with links to purchase them to an Amazon seller account. :#The site in question is very low-quality compared to the rest of the resource links; confusing, messy and difficult to navigate, intrusive music with no way of turning it off, and it has major compatibility problems with Firefox 1.5 and Safari (perhaps others, that's what I've got to try). :That's my 2¢ on this particular site. - a   ::I'll double 's 2¢ and even add in another penny to make it an even nickel.

Visit the other sites, none of them have this info and this is just one instance. You are wrong about it being the normal material.

While you may think that the videos on the site are annoying, many fans love this. I am one of them, I cant think of another site where I can view much of the videos on this site. You say its difficult to navigate and I laugh at that, there is a simple naviagtion bar at the left hand side of each page, just like fleeting glimpses bar.

"`  == About Corticopia ==  ==Corticopia's past ==  Hello:  I just want to share with you some information you might consider important. We had a very difficult time months ago removing Mexico from Central America in the article North America. Why? Because an ``anonimous`` user (IP from Toronto Canada) was reverting all the changes. I finally discovered he was an already registered user and got him blocked because of sockpuppetry. One month later, I found out he was already been accused of sockpuppetry with that account.  Well my point is that he is against of Mexico being included in North America. His main ``argument`` was that the UN geosheme includes Mexico in CA and that's it. He also denies that North America is also a subregion of America and ignores the cited content proving him wrong. Well, he is Corticopia. For months he was retired and trust me, NO BODY changed the articles North America and Central America (specially this one) to say Mexico was in CA.  Suddenly a ``new`` user shows up. He deleted a line in the article CA. It said ``Mexico is rarely, yet sometimes included in Central America under certain definitions``. This line was discussed and agreed. He changed it to ``Mexico is included in Central America`` then to ``Mexico is sometimes included in Central America``.  I don't know what his problem is. The important thing is I totally felt this is the same person we had a very serious vandalism problems months ago, so I checked his edit list. Wow! What a discovery, his first edit was the article Issac Asimov and articles about Canada and some other regions of the world. It was very obvious it was the same person. Please check this sources  and this . Please, read them carefully.  Please check the contributions of each accused sockpuppetry account, specially the one of . It is very obvious he is the same person.  He was dragged into the article Mexico when he was unable to ``win`` again in the article Central America (he didn't even try to change the article North America because he knows a lot of people guard that article). So his reason to say Mexico is in ``Southern North America`` are purely false and personal. He wants to ``exclude`` Mexico or make it ``look`` appart from Canda and the USA.  I'm telling you this because I think you don't realize his reasons are just personal, a personal aversion against Mexico being included in North America. If he's so interested in accuracy of the articles, why isn't he editing the article USA? He even asked Supaman to do it by himself. He's just there to exclude Mexico. Please read carefully the evidence provided in each sockpuppetry case. You said that you're an administrator in Spanish Wikipedia, so I think you're experienced in these cases. You will find it is the same person. Cortiopia has edited the same pattern of articles that the other accounts did. Too bad I warned him and I'm sure he stopped editing with that account to prevent being identified. I think we should stop him and prevent him from editing the article with his biased, excluding information, even if sourced, because his reasons are just personal and not for the sake of accuracy.    `",0,0

If you can prevent them from committing suicide, it will save the doctors alot of paper work and help advance their careers.

Look for you self:  Espionage or a dick spying on some pussy lovers involves an individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as the legitimate holder of the information may change plans or take other countermeasures once it is known that the information is in unauthorized hands. See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection, and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the ``tradecraft`` used to collect this information. Hey I gotta joke and it goes like this:Dick says ``Hey Balls get ready for a patry`` Balls replies ``You fucking liar. Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin.     ==History== Incidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http://www.henrywotton.org.uk/  The Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists.  Different intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred  human sources over  research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU  ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited.     ==Various Forms== Unlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information.  The US defines espionage towards itself as ``The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web   | last = US Department of Defense   | authorlink = U.S. Department of Defense   | title = Joint Publication 1-02 Department of Defe",1,1

It looks like Breiling in Babyblaue is somewhat more reliable a source than Colli in Clouds. Although Colli's observations are interesting, I cannot see keeping them. It's too bad, because he is the only reviewer who hinted at the CD having some loudness war characteristics, a step down from the dynamic spaciousness of the LP. :::About the ``bursts with`` quote from van Peer, the word 'eradicates' was wrong. Van Peer wrote 'eradiates', which is not a word, but he may have intended this construction as a neologism. That, or he misspelled 'radiates'.

No way in hell im going to drop direct tv beacuse viacom wants an extra billion dollars for the stations i hardly ever watch. I watch spike comedy central and mtv 2. So im supposed to pay 30% more for these channels? Why do we have to suffer beacuse some corporate faggot in viacom wants an extra billion dollars a year. Why dont you get the bright idea of charging every television provider like 5% more instead of trying to make direct customers pay 30% more. Does that make sense to them???? Spongebob is possibly the stupidest tv show ever created right next to alf. Hate viacom beacuse its trying to charge your mom and your dad extra every month. Rest assured Viacom would much rather put their channels back on direct tv then loose directs business all togeather. They are trying to act like direct needs them as much as they need direct. Direct is keeping most of its customers if not all of them. Viacom does not need n extra billion dollars from direct when dish stays the same verison fios stays the same time warner stays the same. its a bluff viacom will give in before direct beacuse direct is its number one provider. Hopefully they do go bankrupt. Whoever is able to create a monstrosity such as jersey shore should go bankrupt for ever putting the situation snookie and dena on tv and giving them fame.

I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's ``flat-earth society`` type behaviour that I find objectionable.  I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called ``community``.  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the ``Speedy Deletion`` I could find no such option.  When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for ``Nassim Haramein`` and ``The Resonance Project`` in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-``free`` encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.  This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.  If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?  Best Regards,  J  `",1,0

Since the only apparent motivation for your edit is to supplant WP:SIG#Customizing your signature (an official guideline) with your personal preferences, this constitutes vandalism, and this response constitutes a warning. Please do not alter others' presentations of data without cause, in violation of WP:POINT, creating the very squabbles you claim to wish to avoid in favor of actually writing an encyclopedia.   :Well, ``Vandalism is any addition, deletion, or change to content made in a deliberate attempt to reduce the quality of the encyclopedia.`` I don't see Tony's edits as vandalism (even in an extended sense), though the last few seemed to have a bit of spite and muse to them, which I don't like.   :: If any of my edits have given the impression of spite that was an error. I am aware of no spite.  I only seek to improve the encyclopedia.   : I don't think you quite understand.   Any discussion can be improved by refactoring.  This will inevitably involve, as a desired end product, reduction of noise, the most obvious of which is unnecessary content in signatures, ``compliant`` (whatever that might mean) or not.  Discussions are about, believe it or not, the exchange of information, not the repeated depositing of random graffiti on pages devoted to discussion of a subject not related to that graffiti.  : I'm running out of polite ways to say ``you are behaving  in an incredibly stupid manner; please reconsider your approach to Wikipedia.``  -   ::Hey, Tony, per our Wikien-L discussion... if you're pissing people off seriously when you do it, knock off doing it.

But I am saying, and have said (with a chorus of agreements, but not unanimity) on Wikien-L that the consequences of getting people angry by refactoring sigs in a manner they believe is abusive is worse than the consequences of leaving the sigs as is.  There's been discussion about a signature size limit, which I support, in some form or another.  But the side effects of refactoring a bunch of random people's sigs are that they're percieving it as abuse by Tony, not as a cleanup effort, and reasonable people should always think twice if people complain that they're being abusive. :The proper solution to this has to either be Tony being a lot more polite about the refactoring (for example, telling people on their talk pages, nicely asking them to change, ec), or for there to be a policy change that limits sig size so there's no question as to whether the refactor is ``ok`` or not.  Tony irritating people when he's acting fully in compliance with policy is acceptable to me.  Tony irritating or abusing people when policy has gotten vague on a point, is not.

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't Hüttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died?

An ugly personal attack, by a person who has in essence defamed a widely respected organization  the National Civilian Community Corps  by posting false and misleading information at the Wikipedia website.  If your / Wikipedia's best idea is that what should happen next is that I enter into a prolonged dialogue with that person, hoping to reason with him/her, while he/she continues to exert control over content and issue ugly diatribes, then your processes leave a great deal to be desired.

As I read it, there was objection at one of your pages to placing references at the end of that phrase rather than at the end of the quotation.  Why an encyclopedia would have as a policy including bald claims (as if fact) without reference to the source in its text eludes me.  It would give the impression that the encyclopedia had evaluated the statement, which is obviously not the case.   I appreciate Wikipedia's effort to provide freely accessible information to the public.  I am not impressed, however, by the response to gross errors made at the Wikipedia site.

"`  == RE: Academics  ==   The below section under ``Academics`` as written:   It should be noted that Irvington High School was once not a school with high academic achievements. It has been said that the sole reason for Irvington's recent development in that category is the transfer of students from Weibel Elementary School. However, while it's obvious Weibel Elementary School has made a positive change on Irvington's test scores, Weibel Elementary School is only a small portion of Irvington's students. A much greater possibility is that students from other schools served as examples, and the inspiration was enough to raise Irvington's academic achievement.    The above passaage is bias and speculative, and should warrant a citation. Student from Weibel Elementary School do not, nor cannot feed directly into Irvington High School. As is the case in any public school system in the United States, unless a student is gifted, elementry school students matriculate into a junior high or middle school, than they move onto high school.   I recommend that this whole section be stricken. I attended Irvington High School in the early 1990's and the differnece between the Weible neighborhood of Fremont and Irvington disctrict is very little. Both are middle to upper middle class, with the housing tracks in Weibel being slightly newer than the older housing track of Irvington district. While the Weibel neighborhood benefited from the high tax revenues of other parts of mission san jose district, very little seperates the two area other than a larger working class population in the Irvington district as a result of the pre-silcon valley economies in which many autoworkers from Genreal Motors in Fremont, Peterbuilt, Trail Mobile, and Caterpillar in Newark,Ca, and Ford Motors in Milpitas,CA resided in the Irvington district. However, as Unionized laborers these workers made a good wage for the time, maybe as well of a living as those currently in the Weibel neighborhood given inflation and cost of living in California of the 1970's and 1980's.   If this section should stay it should speak rather to the major re-organzation that took place in the middle to late 90's under the leadership of Principal Gaskill and Vice-Principal (current Principal) Pete Murchison (check spelling). As all of the accolades currently enjoyed by IHS were earned prior the the FUSD reorganization which placed the Weibel neighborhood  in the IHS service area. This can easily be verifyed by crossing the early state-wide and national honors Irvington High School earned in the mid-1990's. Thus, de-bunking the assertion that Weibel neighborhood elemtry school students are responsible for the academic excellence of IHS.`",0,0

I am not a stupid person.

It is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee. ::We must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee. ::We cannot question articles about their content, nor can we ask the content questions, but we can ask the proposed contents of the ArbCom questions. ::Is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to ArbCom membership? If you do not think so, how many of the present ArbCom do you consider stupid? Would a low intellect on ArbCom help or hinder? If there is evidence (a diff) of intellectual failings, does the candidate realise this failing? Can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing? The questions were politely put. They were challenging, and they were meant to be, and anyone in the community (which includes me) has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance.

"`  == This is A Potentially Ridiculous Article ==  Seriously, it is a potentially ridiculous article, and mislead readers to comprehend the word ``x86``, for the following reasons:  1. Should sort AMD64 or Intel64 implementations as x86? Generally ``x86`` was used to point all the processors compatible with IA-32 ISA, might or might name themselves with ``86``, such as Cyrix 5x86, Intel Pentium 4 and so on. AMD64's long mode is devised by AMD rather than Intel, so how can one sort them together. Nowadays software labeled themselves as ``x86`` are IA-32 compatible software, and use ``x64`` or ``x86-64`` differentiating with it. So this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word.   2. Generations? What is the 8th generation x86 processor? Who invented this kinda processors? AMD K8 just says that it succeeds AMD K7 rather than saying it is the 8th x86 processor, and I've never heard Intel call their x86 processors exceeding the 7th generation. And one thing should never be denied, the first generation of Itanium processor says its family model number as 7, which might potentially imply that Itanium might be the 7th x86 processor succeeding Pentium III, but none confirmed this. So take turn back the Transmeta's Crusoe and Efficeon, if the morph firmed on the system board implements x86 decoder call themselves as x86 processors, then if put the same processor on another board implementing PowerPC decoder, then it would be the PowerPC processor? At this situation, what kind of processor is it? Ridiculous! What's more for what sort it as the 7th/8th generation x86? Who is another Jane Austen, making up another Northanger Abbey?  3. ``x86`` is one architecture(ISA) name? What such a ridiculous thing that I've ever heard on earth! ``x86`` is used to referring the processor, a kind or series of processors rather than an architecture. If it were the name of an architecture, then in this logic way, Intel 80486 is one of the ``implementation`` of this ``architecture``?   `",0,1

I do plan to expand the Papakating Creek article and think (a) there are more resources for such content and (b) there a larger exposition on course, watershed, hydrology, geology content would be more appropriate. Further, as MOS eschews short sectionsMOS:PARAGRAPHS says ``Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading``, it would be inadvisable per the MOS layout guidelines vis-à-vis their application for GA evaluation to start creating short sections.

You display the insight of a 100 year old women that has suffered from Alzheimer's for 20 years. You don't even deserve a user page you PC using paper pusher.  I've said it once and I'll say it again- it's people like you, with little to no creativity and a desk job from 9-5, that get your kicks out on start up wikipedians. Your power is falsified and if ever one day something happens to the infrastructure of the internet, you'd be shit out of luck like a milkman in the 1980's.

I think it's time you get some poon. You don't know what poon is?  Here you go, read about it.  3. Do you put your wikipedia skills on your resume? Just curious.  4. Do you have cyber with any of your fellow wikipedians?

Moments ago I edited the ``lead`` content for the article. My reason for doing this is because the ``lead`` was repetitious. As I wrote in the editing note, which state: ``Repetitious lead -Lead info is covered in the article in same order. Previous lead was not ``whitewashed`` - Kimes is best known for 2 murders and the locations - This correction is neutral and factual``    I believe the change I made was of a neutral point of view and was supported by referenced links within said article.   The change I made had previously been posted by an administrator that I am apparently having trouble with. I had hoped to work with the administrator in a constructive effort to improve the said article. However, it appears that said administrator is making changes to said article out of spite or personal feelings against me or the article's subject. I had mentioned to the administrator in said article's discussion page that is they had a problem with the articles subject, then maybe another administrator could assist me in creating a neutral point of view for the article.   On the said article's discussion page, there have been several biased statements by said administrator about the article's subject. And, I feel, about me simply because I would like the said article to be 'balanced' and neutral.   I am wanting to document any issue here as so that if there is a problem later, it has been documented on my talk page. NOTE: I am not naming the administrator as a favor even though I doubt the attempted favor will be appreciated. Furthermore, if there is a problem later, I do have it.

I was aware of the term ('Golodomor' in Russian transliteration) as the ``the great famine of early 1930s throughout the Soviet Union, predominantly in the Ukraine, but also in Southern Russia, due to the policies of the collectivisation and de-kulakization.`` There was no connection or comparisons to Holocaust in my mind, in part because the term Holocaust was not in use in the general discourse. It was as if WWII happened but Holocaust did not. That was really weird.   Now, the term Holocaust in Russian is much more common. However, the two words look differently in Russian - Gogolomor and Holokost; so that's why (with my background) is hard to see a connection, although I'm more aware now of how it became a political rather than just a historic term.   Hope this clarifies my perspective. Again, sorry about the choice of language on the Holodomor Talk page.    .`",0,0

"  User Kannambadi, please do not try to frighten and justify blocks on me.  Did the person who blocked me on two occasions (first of all I do know, it was you and your other friends who cannot tolerate a counter opinion, who prompted the irresponsible blocking on the previous occasions.... you are again giving a seemingly sage advice for first discussing before carrying out edits.... do you remember what you told the user (I forget his name, but he was from Maharashtra)?  You wrote: I borrow from Kamath, you go and get it from a good library. I have a good library near my home and town, where the book is available. Thus, you left it all on the person countering YOUR opinion to prove otherwise.... Why not do the same thing this time around?    I have indeed borrowed from two books called Ancient India, one by K.A.N.Sastri and R.C.Roychowdhuri. These are two books of the same name by the above named two authors with Roychowdhuri borrowing extensively from Sastri.  I also think that the book by K.A.N.Sastri is dated 1959 while the one of Roychowdhury is either 1951 or 1961, probably it is 1961 edition.  Roychowdhuri's book is quite different from the edition of the same book available on the internet at books.google.com/.  Please also try preaching the same to the irresponsible user who blocked me in that he should also have practiced what you are preaching me.... that is first indulge in a discussion before taking action to block contributors like me. Did he do that? He simply barged into my page like a bull in the china shop and blindly commented that I have made personal commentary on the Chola page and hence he was blocking me.  This after I had painstakingly borrowed from noted epigraphist Huntzsh's summary of the rule of the Chola empire where he had sought to dispel the notions that they were devout Saivites by saying that during the rule of the second Chola king i.e. Aditya I itself, two temples i.e. the Siva Temple of Chidambaram and the one at Srirangam being a Vishnu temple and regarded the most important Siva and Vishnu temples, were both declared as Kuladhanam (family heritage sites) for the Chola kings (ordaining in a way that the kings of this dynasty one after another will look personally after the upkeep of traditions at both the temples and their well being). Indeed, I made the mistake of not quoting Prof. Huntzsh (again courtesy the site you love to deride calling it a POV website despite using it to support points on Chalukyas and Hoysalas) but on my very next visit on the same day, I found that the 'department of dirty tricks' had prompted Blinguen to block me for the second time. Does Blinguen have any knowledge at all of Indian history, most of all of the history of the Cholas, Hoysalas or Pandiyans and most of all of your beloved Chalukya Cholas?  Certainly I would have loved to engage him on a one to one debate on Indian history especially that of South India.  I also wrote to Taprobanus wanting to prosecute Blinguen and requested for his address.    It is a shame that cowards contacted him it seems on the email or on phone to complain about me, but no one ever wrote about it in the open, no one contacted me and most of all no one ever wanted to discuss the matter. Rather, people who scarcely contributed to the Chola page like user Earth etc. started advocating this and that.  Mind you, user Earth himself was adviced by another admin when he complained about me that the contributions made by me were in good faith only, but it seems ultimately the dirty gang on wikipedia bent upon converting it into some sort of monkeypedia finally had their say.  What you basically always do is you want to write and not just that, you want whatever you write to be retained at all costs, but in the process, you forget counter opinions by other historians as well.  K.A.N.Sastri has written in his book (as opposed to what you wrote quoting Kamath that Satyasraya defeated crown prince Rajendra), that Rajendra Chola defeated Satyasraya (he wrote something like: next was the turn of Satyasraya who fled the battlefield near the fields of Hottur-??) and hid in the jungles of Kogali and Kadambalige.  I would say 'exactly' for you find among the limited number of inscriptions available of Satyasraya (courtesy: the site you always try to trash inscriptions.whatsindia.com/) which are indeed found at Kogali and Kadambalige and in fact in a couple of these inscriptions Satyasraya even is called as 'ruling from Kadambalige'. Kindly access this information in the same manner as I have done and exactly in the same manner as you expect others to do, i.e. access appropriate information from appropriate sources.   Even in this, I do not want to claim whatever I say is correct, indeed if Satyasraya is attributed by Kamath with victory over Rajendra then kindly also quote other sources where Rajendra claims victory over the Chalukyas including the most important World Heritage Site inscription at the Tanjore temple where almost all Chola kings have left their inscriptions.  Mind you I have also gone to Tanjore and met the office and museum of the current heir (king of Tanjore Kshatrapati but king only in name and not in status - he is just a protector and guard of the Maratha palace and all artefacts and preserver of heritage items) where inscriptions not just in stone but also in metal mainly copper are present till date and can be seen by anybody where Prof. Huntzsh and his successor Prof. Vijay Reddy who was appointed by the ASI to study monuments, temples and countless artefacts have visited and have based their summaries given in inscriptions.whatsindia.com/ and their numerous books.  These findings rise far, far above parochial 'history' books, be it those written in Kannada, Tamil or any other language.  But it is even more of a pity that someone who calls himself a 'Senior Wikipedian' should have stooped so low as to call the whatsindia.com website a POV website especially when used to contend in support of Cholas or Pandiyas but scarcely so when supporting Chalukya/Hoysala history. Kindly remember, sauce for the goose is also sauce for the gander.  You also gave a very sheepish (quite shameful you will admit) argument when you clarified probably to Nishkid when you mentioned that the inscriptions of Cholas are detailed about victory but silent about defeats.... I wonder why that should not apply to Chalukyas or Hoysalas too? tsk tsk tsk....????  Hope you will learn to accept points of views of others also..... which I am sure you will do because you are a SENIOR WIKIPEDIAN.     -",0,0

"`   :History and Giving Context for Atlanta Demographics - adding numbers to population chart While Fulton County did not encompass all of what is in the Atlanta SMSA today, I think it is misleading to provide only Atlanta City population numbers in the mid-19th c. While it was established as a railroad terminus, it didn't exist by itself.  In 1860 Fulton County had a total of 14,427 people.  There were 2955 enslaved African-Americans, 20.5% of the population.  While much of north GA had mostly yeoman farmers, both Cobb and Fulton County also had planters (defined by historians as holding 20 or more slaves), who held slaves for labor on large cotton plantations.   (I know more about Roswell in Cobb county, than Fulton, but the origins of major planters and the slaves they brought with them are likely similar. Roswell King and planters he invited to join him in his enterprise (at what became Roswell) were from the coast. King brought 36 slaves from his coastal plantation and bought another 42 at Darien, GA, to take with him to work on building his house, the mill, and supporting buildings. Archibald Smith brought 36 slaves with him from his coastal plantations in St. Marys County and created a 300-acre cotton plantation in Roswell. King's idea was to have cotton production AND  processing in the same place. The forced migration of slaves from the coast to north GA meant they brought their unique Geechee culture and language with them.  Where slaves were held in larger numbers on plantations, it's likely they kept their culture and traditions going.)   Atlanta and Fulton County in fact more than doubled in population from 1860 to 1870. People rushed to rebuild the city.  In a pattern typical of other areas, many newly freed African-Americans left plantations to move to town to work at trades or crafts, to have safety in numbers and to try to set up lives apart from white control.    By 1870 Fulton County had grown to 33,446 people.  Among them were 15,282 ``colored``, as defined by the census, 45.7% of the population.   NOTEWORTHY CITIZENS: Atlanta boasts two Nobel Prize winners: Rev. Martin Luther King, the youngest man to receive the Nobel Prize, and President Jimmy Carter.  Each were awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.    `",0,0

What's the explanation?  The Cabal is, obviously, trying to manipulate the encyclopedia article 'jim bell', to keep its errors and omissions from being fixed.  But that's not enough.  They want to (need to!) conceal evidence of their nefarious activites, and that includes instantly (if possible) removing critical references to their misconduct, even on the talk:jim bell page.  (And all references to their misconduct will be critical:  The Cabal ignores all objections to its manipulations, other than to delete, reverse, erase, or otherwise conceal them.)   It remains no violation of WP rules to post from an IP address, particularly if the Cabal is preventing people from correcting an articles errors by any other means.  The Cabal blocks people illegally, so the public is forced to employ other tactics to avoid the Cabal's finagling fingers.  Fortunately, the identities of the Cabal are now (at least, in part) being exposed.  Skomorokh, strangely, is holding back, perhaps fearful of losing control over his high-priority 'assignment'.  Actually, if Skomorokh were honest and ethical, he would by now either have weighed in on the subject, or he would have explicitly dissociated himself from the dispute.  (Rather than merely remaining silent.) And since most of the incorrect 'misinformation' on 'jim bell' originated from Skomorokh's edits, he should be willing to step aside and allow his errors to be corrected.        `",0,0

"`  == Putting an end to this. ==  More useless assumptions from the ``trained classicist.`` Let's clear up a few things before our disagreements go too far.  1) I was not implying that the ``Etruscan`` and ``Anatolian`` views should be removed. I was simply stating that the data in the literary and archaeological sections provides a stronger case. Moreover, discussing the realities that exist in academic institutions also does not imply that I want to remove the ``Etruscan`` and ``Anatolian`` views. Direct evidence is needed to support any viewpoint whether literary, archaeological, or both. Stop using the ``original research`` card just because you don't agree with other users let alone base your notions of other users on faulty assumptions.   2) You state that Herodotus meant ``non-Hellenic`` when he called the Pelasgian language ``barbaric.`` Well, I am afraid you are wrong. In accordance to modern secondary sources, Herodotus called the language of the Pelasgians ``barbaric.`` Here is just a sample to prove this basic fact (more sources are on their way):  *Herodotus's Conception of Foreign Languages - I do not know why you deleted this when you began editing the Pelasgians article. However, the information it contains is valuable for clarifying whatever ``disputes`` exist over Herodotus's statements. It is as much of a valuable external link as your Godley reference. The only difference entails the fact that Thomas Harrison's article is from the 1990s and Godley's interpretation of Herodotus's statements date back to the Roaring 20s.   3) Your interpretation of the Skourta Plain project's findings is atrocious to say the least. The areas that were identified as ``Pelasgian sites`` were Middle Helladic (i.e. Minyan) and Late Helladic (i.e. Mycenean) sites. Either way you slice it, you are talking about two different kinds of ``proto-Greek``. I am well aware of the fact that the Foreigners and Barbarians addition causes some dissonance, but the source reflects a ``carry-over effect`` (i.e. since the Pelasgians lived until Herodotus's time, then it would make sense to acknowledge the fluidity of ethnicity between Greeks and Pelasgians and not just between Dorians and Ionians or Spartans and Athenians). If you want to remove the verifiable text associated with the Foreigners and Barbarians citation, then by all means do so. I don't care. However, I deliberately cite direct quotes so that readers can find more easily the source of any data shown in the article.   4) Just so you know, I am not making any claim to special authority. I am merely emphasizing the fact that I have experience with the article's content evolution. The only reason my statements are ``obscure`` to you is because you perceive them as ``obscure.`` Also, don't put words in my mouth. I never stated that you should ``get my permission`` before working on the article. I stated that you should consult with me so that a rudimentary form of collaboration can be established. Moreover, I do not ``own`` the article since I do not carry the ``deed`` in my pocket (except, yes, Jimbo Wales). So, please don't waste your breath about such notions. Also, I did not ``lose my temper.`` Being adamant does not always have to entail losing one's temperance. You of all people should know that much. So, please don't waste your time with such notions. On a sidenote, you didn't bother to critique my work since you simply deleted the majority of it. For me to question your edits on minor levels is not a crime just so you know.

Explain to the world, how putting Greek homosexuals on a pedestal, is in any way, shape, or form, NPOV.  You know, Greek scholars on the matter paint homosexuality in a different hue than outsiders who romanticize the subject (e.g. Oliver Stone's Alexander (film)).  They see homosexuality as existing all over the world and in all eras.  To portray Ancient Greece as some buggery paradise is prejudiced and ignorant, just as if they were all claimed to be paragons of heterosexual machismo.  Gay Greeks are your Wandering Jew.  Whenever I watched Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess, homosexuality did not come to mind.  Perhaps the slash fiction community would rather Hercules and Xena ``get nasty`` with their traveling companions, but that's beside the point.  You can't always have it to your fantasy or ideal, simply by calling other people ``narrow``.  So far, you've succeeded in stereotyping Greeks as rabid homosexuals.  Out of all the characteristics of the Hellenic people, founders of Europe, you had to claim that their homosexuals were most importanteven iconic representations of the West.  Nobody said they were all straight either, which is something you have to admit.  Homosexual revisionism is not fact.   `",0,1

Parish churches and the Interior Ministry supplied birth records showing who was Jewish; the Post Office delivered the deportation and denaturalization orders; the Finance Ministry confiscated Jewish property; German firms fired Jewish workers and disenfranchised Jewish stockholders.`` Also, in the book The Death Marches: The Final Phase of Nazi Genocide the author writes of numerous incidents where German civilians hunted down concentration camp inmates, or murdered groups of them as they passed through their villages in forced marches.

Even learning martial arts, there would always be a chance the sweeper might be more proficent or just plain get lucky and take him down. Not to mention fighting is going to take up valuable time. Even a few seconds would be time Jarod might not be able to spare as he could not be absolutely certain that in that time more sweepers, or Miss Parker, would be able to close in and catch him.

"   == Ross Perot and the Reform Party ==  I edited to include Ross Perot because his candidacy everywhere was talked about as appealing to the 'radical middle' (in the press even). He said he was a social moderate and fiscal conservative, but his general tone was of centrismwhich is why for years after 'swing voters'/centrist voters/independents were called 'Perot voters'. On most issues he came to compromises between Democrats and Republicans with hard solutions. For instance he said both tax cuts and tax increases were needed. He also felt that partisanship and gridlock between the parties caused most problems, including incessant debates on social issues like abortion. But he promoted issues that appealed to the center (that weren't just plain 'centrist' but pro-active positions that at that time hadn't been talked about much before) like balanced budgets, campaign finance reform, referendums, term limits, etc.  The Reform Party was based on this platform and was radically centristmembers even called themselves 'centrist'. People in the party felt there were definite issues that needed to be solved, and the two major parties had to be challenged to solve them, with the creation of a new party. Today, many might say the party has a chink in this line of thought, because after Pat Buchanan and his supporters entered the party in the 2000 election, hard stances on immigration started to enter party platforms.  Which is somewhat right-but even still it doesn't compromise on the idea. I read Noam Chomsky once wrote that in America the groups on the fringes of politicslike Nader on the left, Buchanan on the right, and Perot in the center, agreed substantially on their significant issuesand he proposed that they joined together in a pretzel to form the 'radical middle'. A radical 'centrist' is an uneasy concept, since politics always changes and what will be moderate will change. The idea here though is that there is a growing set of issues that is not shared by left or right parties (fair trade, campaign finance reform, balanced budgets). That those who support these issues also carry different baggage of their own, tied to left-right positions, like Buchanan with abortion or immigration, should be expected.  If you're talking about John McCain, he plays to many of these positions (but is still free trade). But he's usually still what you might call a 'sensible' centrist and usually falls on the right, where he is. I was in the Reform Party (i think my analysis is accurate so don't bring up the bias), and many members hated McCain because he was a 'false reformer'-for instance his McCain-Feingold act made it even harder for third parties, while not doing anything substantial for reform. The sentiment was that he was just taking advantage of the issues for his public image. If you even listen to his speeches on reform he gives no substance just uses the phrase 'special interests' liberally.  From what I know about UK politics, Tony Blair looks more like Clintonesque centrism (which is purely political) than anything else.   ",0,0

The trouble is that you have reverted some of my corrections to this page in your addition. Can you pleae be more careful when adding material that you dont destroy peoples improvements? BTW can you please sign your posts by typing four tildes so we know who to reply to. Thanks.   I think that a clear need exists for the division between balanced and unbalanced transmission lines. Many aerials are balanced such as the centre fed half wave dipole, these aerials can be fed using a balanced line which is connected directly to the some old equipment or via a balun in the shack. The other option is to use a balun near the feed point of the aerial and an unbalanced feeder (This arrangement normally leads to higher losses, but it is more EMC friendly). While the use of long runs of balanced feeder is something which many people outside of the radio community are unaware of, it is a concept which is very important and WP will be better if such things are included.  Sorry I overwrote any improvements which another editor made, but I was reverting some changes which had made the lecher line section into dire state where it was not in the correct order.   :Yes but we dont want to turn it into page on Ham radio solely- its about transmission lines. Sounds like we need a page on aerial matching however, aerial feeders (bal and unbal) are I think are appropriate on this page. ",0,0

"`  == Identity of the designer ==  The paragraph just above the heading ``Origins of the term`` states:  ``Intelligent design deliberately does not try to identify or name the specific agent of creation — it merely states that one (or more) must exist. Although intelligent design itself does not name the designer, the personal view of many proponents is that the designer is the Christian god.[34][22][35] Whether this was a genuine feature of the concept or just a posture taken to avoid alienating those who would separate religion from the teaching of science has been a matter of great debate between supporters and critics of intelligent design. The Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District court ruling held the latter to be the case.``  The above statement contains a popular misconception about the identity of the designer. ID leaders have indeed named the designer.   The article's reference #34 above is to Dembski's 1999 Touchstone article in which he says that ``intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory.`` When Dembski said that, he was identifying, indeed defining, the designer as not only God but Jesus Christ, to which ``Logos`` refers in the Gospel of John, as Barbara Forrest points out on pp. 3-4 of her paper http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/intelligent-design.pdf.  See also the article's reference #142 at pp. 39-40 of ``Is It Science Yet? Intelligent Design Creationism and the Constitution,`` at  http://law.wustl.edu/WULQ/83-1/p%201%20Brauer%20Forrest%20Gey%20book%20pages.pdf.  Note here also that Phillip Johnson also defines ID as requiring God when he defines it as ``theistic realism.``  So it is clear that it is more than ``a personal view of many proponents`` that the designer is the Christian God.   `",0,0

"   == Heaven of God == For the atheist anarchist, the subject is Heaven, and it is religion, moron> I saw your kind at University, go feed yourself in the mountains.   To understand Heaven, then God must be understood:  * 1. God is the all powerful supreme being of the Universe. * 2. Universe is defined as everything that is seen and unseen, and defined as everything known and unknown. Any concept of a multi-universe shall be defined as the mathematical subspace where there can be many subspaces, but only one Universe. A mathematical subspace is a subset of dimensions that does not have to include all other dimensions. The subspace we exist within can be a subspace of a larger subspace. The subspace that includes all dimensions is the Universe itself. The Universe itself is a subspace that includes all dimensions. * 3. God is either above the Universe as the creator, or part of some subspace of the Universe, or both above and part of the Universe. The fourth condition that God is not part of the Universe, and God is not above the Universe negates God's existence; therefore, the fourth condition is not considered a valid condition of God. * 4. God is supreme over the Universe. It is God's creation and obeys God's rules. Each rule can be obvious or non-obvious, and each rule can be hidden or allowed to be known. * 5. God has the ability to create and destroy energy. Without such a thing, then the Universe simply exists and is eternal and everlasting with no known explanation of its ability to exist; there can still be God as a supreme being of the Universe in such a condition, but God's energy ability is changed to the ability to manipulate energy without the ability to create or destroy energy. * 6. God is smart, is intelligent, is wise, has knowledge, is a creator, is good, is benevolent, has mercy, and has understanding. God has these abilities that are significant as the supreme being of the Universe. * 7. God expects God's creation to do well, since as a creator, then the Universe was created for God's purpose and enjoyment; therefore, life elements of God's creation, such as people, are expected to improve their own condition for their benefit and exercise wisdom, understanding, and knowledge when possible to exercise such thingsintelligence is good. * 8. Because God is supreme, then Heaven and its rules of existence are defined by God. * 9. God not only deals with people of Earth of our Sol system of the Milky Way galaxy, God is a supreme being that can interact with the entire Universe in whole, or God can interact with the Universe in part; therefore, God truly understands some of the issues and survival strategies of life, and this implies that God may be truly forgiving and God may expect certain behavior for the improvement of ourselvesto survive and prosper is important. * 10. It is always believed that God likes people, so help from God can be asked by petition for help or intervention using prayer. * 11. God likes to be acknowledged from God's own creation, so it is good to acknowledge God as the benevolent intelligent creator of the Universe. * 12. Love God. Love is a survival strategy of people that helps to define society, family, nation, benevolence, and many good things of life. Be who you are as a person and love God, and God is expected to understand this as love is part of the defining qualities of people.  God has created the Universe and has the ability to define Heaven in any way. Each person can get a personal Heaven, or Heaven may be a interaction for people, or Heaven may be a combination of both personal and interaction of people. Heaven is always defined as a good place; but, a personal Heaven can also be a personal Hell tailored to your life, attitude, and existence where God could give us, by observation, an environment where the individual prospered. The personal Heaven and Hell would be much like an metaphorical ant farm that is designed for ants, but you would not expect things like body building equipment in the ant farm, and the ant farm would function in a way ants survive, and this can be bad news for people who were ruthless where their environment was ruthlessness as a survival strategy (visit a zoo and see how the environmentshowever limitedare tailored to the different animal species).  God can define Heaven in any way, and Heaven is defined as a good place, but as a supreme being God can allow many things, and maybe God might include a body building set for the metaphorical ant farm, so the possibilities of Heaven are expected to be many, if not endless possibilities. God is benevolent in Heaven and the possibilities are many. Love God.",0,1

In terms wording altering I guess could be changed however the Zerefos paper mentions and explicit artificial effect on Thiseio due to change of equipment from the mid 90's onwards and adopts the view that it can not be concluded that either the UHI or the GW effect can be considered the main reasons for this.  We could also adopt something along the lines areas protected by greenery even at the very centre of Athens seem to not be affected by the UHI",0,0

"`  Hmmm, but the situation there (Madrid, and Spain in general...) is also not so good now. The unnemployment is huge! My favourite place in Spain is Benalmadena a costal town near Marbella where all the cool Spanish people use to go, because Marbella is too turistic, and Benalmadena was still undiscouvered by the ``people`` or mass tourism. Another reason are the great golf courses that are near. P.S.:You said in your comment ``we are just a little bit richer``, it can´t apply to Serbia, because it´s way much poorer than in the 80´s. Yugoslav Serbia was way better. There was freedom to travel (to Yugoslav citizens wasn´t even required visas for majority of western countries) and had, limited throu, private property or companies. We had the EURO in 1976, Olympic winter games in 1984, the non-alignement was a very interesting initiative... Younger people (even in Serbia too) doesn´t know much of that. Almost all Serb families had a house on the Adriatic, going skiing was usual, travelling to Austrian or Swiss Alps, to Italy or Spain in summer, was ``normal`` to many Belgraders. I see you been to South Serbia (Niš and Leskovac), but you should have in mind that Belgrade and the northern part was and is way more richer (double, or even more). About the separatism, it was a huge error (for Serbia) not to allow to Croatia and Slovenia to be independent during the monarchic period. All the rest of the country was suposed to belong to Serbia (call me nationalist, but that is a fact). Even Yugoslavia was created so there wouldn´t be a ``big`` orthodox Kingdom of Serbia. Neither Vatican, Austria, Germany or Turkey, neither France and UK (with excuse of the possibility of that Serbia becoming a allied of Russia) wanted that, so a ``neutral`` Yugoslavia was imposed. About the Serbian-Bulgarian problem, it all begin when Serbia was not allowed to have direct access to see, so it had to be compensated with lands, part of current Macedonia, that were suposed to belong to Bulgaria. I know and recognise that. You have the maps on the page (Kingdom of Serbia) where you see that the Serbo-Bulgarian border was moved east, so that Albaian state was created. All current Eastern Macedonia was given to Serbia as compensation for taking Albania from Serbia. We could talk centuries about it, wright?   `",0,0

"`  :Ok, first off, let me clarify that reverting is when you undo someone else's edit (yes, it does include the re-addition of material that has been removed by another user). Your use of the word ``vandalism`` is incorrect in this case, because everything that you have been involved in so far is classified as a ``content dispute``, since you and your opponents have been disputing whether certain text should be included. This is not a case of vandalism (this is, for example). Secondly, many of the users that you have been reverting or the ones that have been reverting you are on the same restrictions, so IMO now everyone is equal, and no one is ``winning`` or ``losing``. What I've tried to explain to you is that edit wars get nothing accomplished. You keep reverting and reverting, and then someone reverts you, and the cycle continues. Wikipedia articles aren't meant to go back-and-forth like that. The only real way you get something accomplished is by discussing it with other users, in the hopes that you can form a compromise, or consensus. To answer your numbered questions: :#After we last spoke you continued to revert (, , , ). On Sason, you reverted 3 times in the last 24 hours. Even though you came close to breaking the three-revert rule (which you were blocked for on May 31), three reverts is not some sort of magic barrier that prevents you from being blocked. An admin could have easily blocked you for simply edit warring. This is the type of stuff that occurred on Armenian-Azeri pages for example before the arbitration case. After that many users were placed on editing restrictions, a lot of the problems were solved. Aggressive editing can be characterized as constant edit warring, and basically a method of getting your version of the article by constant reverting as opposed to discussion. Is is the exact opposite of what is outlined at WP:1RR. Even if you believe the information you are adding is NPOV, if it is contested by several users, the best thing is to discuss it with them, and once you have come to an agreement, to implement that version.  :#I'm sure you've tried to be civil, but here I notice you referring to your opponents as ``vandals``, this is inappropriate because as I explained above, you're involved in a content dispute here. If other users have personally attacked you, please show me links of this and I will warn them. It is never acceptable to do so. :#Yes, it is possible. You can get mentored at Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User. Wiki-adoption was created back in 2006 as a program designed to help new and inexperienced users. :#Although you may disagree with him, it is within Namsos' right to nominate an article for deletion if he believes it is non-notable. However, as you can see from the discussion at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erich Feigl, it appears that many users there are deciding to keep the article, so I'm not sure that it matters anyways. Everything that you mention (awards, documentaries, books, Google hits, etc.) can be mentioned at the AfD (articles for deletion page). I have noticed that you've already made a comment there already. Make sure to keep an eye on that page, the discussion is typically open for five days. :#I don't know the specifics about why your sources were removed, but if you feel like you're not getting anywhere with these disputes, you might try posting something at the Reliable Sources noticeboard if there is a dispute on whether your sources are valid or not. Another option is the new Ethnic and cultural conflicts noticeboard. Finally, after you have made all attempts at resolving the conflict (including those two links I gave you), and you still feel like nothing has been accomplished, you can check out formal mediation. There, a mediator will get involved and act as a third party. :I hope all that I have said is helpful.

ACDCPres   == Farting ==  I reverted this article back to a recent version that contained the term fart. Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia (not a medical one), and its important to use a term that a majority of people know. Flatulence is no more or less a ``proper`` term than farting is, and its definetly not slang  its use is too common, everyday, and widespread. It would be a misservice the readers to simply ignore this important term. Its such a odd thing to want to sensor.    :I agree. Why use the word ``flatus`` all over the place? People don't know it's fart. Doctors know it's fart, and, well, doctors are people, but they ain't most people. The common term is fart or gas.  —   |   ::The reason seems pretty obvious to me: ``fart`` is a much rougher, less ``refined`` word. Using it casually is simply not appropriate tone for an encyclopedia. -     == Citations needed ==  Oh come on, not EVERY sentence needs a citation now, does it.. It makes articles really hard to read and is just silly. I am talking about the section ``Dietary`` where every second word has a citation or ``citation needed``. Whoever posted all that is obsessed with citations. seriously!   :I agree, especially since the rest of the article doesn't seem to conform to the extreme citation standards in the Dietary section. Additionally, some of the stuff is a given and doesn't really need a citation unless you happen to be an alien from another planet who is completely unfamiliar with Earth, in which case it remains a mystery how this alien learned enough english to understand this article without learning some basic information about humans and Earth. Not everyone is a wikipedia administrator, y'know.       == ICD infobox ==  Why is this article topped by a medical infobox? In the vast majority of occurances, flatulence has nothing to do with either disease or dysfunction.      == Post release ==  In 1998, Chester ``Buck`` Weimer of Pueblo, Colorado, USA received a patent for the first undergarment that contained a replaceable charcoal filter.

"`That's what's known as a ``tortured reading`` of the statute.  There's nothing particularly special about King's Highways.  It just means a road:  *bigger than a cow path,  *for vehicular travel,  *that has been registered,  *that is controlled and maintained by the province.     That's all in the definitions in Part I.

It is particularly telling that the other Acts, such as the HTA, use somewhat different phraseology.  If this were language with strong legislative intent, arguably you'd find greater consistency.

" I feel it is wrong to write of Saira and her father Idries Shah as being Afghan. Afghan proper is a Pashtun whereas Idries Shah claimed Syed i.e. Arab ancestory as indicated by his surname Shah. Moreover, this family cannot be termed Afghan/Scottish either but Indian/Scottish as they have been resident in India sor many generation. One can be Afghanistani and not be Pashtun as it is a nationality not an ethnic/racial label. Therefore, the term Afghan is retained for Pashtuns of the former NWFP (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)and Balochistan in Pakistan - it is represented by the second letter in the name PAKISTAN i.e. Afghania. NWFP which was until 1901 legitimately the Eastern Afghanistan province was incorporated by into British India but to this day the border, known as Durand Line, is challenged by Pashtuns from sides of the dividing line between Pakistan and Afghanistan. In case of Idries Shah and his family they are neither Afghans ethnically nor Afghanistanis nationally. ([User: Moarrikh])",0,0

"`Kurt and Dave get it on?==  Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.  To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.  Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.  That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.  Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.  Dave shoved Kurt away, ``What part of no don't you fucking understand!?``  Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, ``Guys, I think—``  Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.  ``I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,`` Dave growled. ``In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.``  Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.  He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.  ``I'm just gonna... go,`` Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.  ``You're fucking mine, Dave,`` Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. ``Always.``  For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.  Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, ``You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.``  ``Stop! Kurt, stop!`` Dave struggled.  With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.  Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.  Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.  Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now.   Does anyone have any basis for this rumour?

" ::::We might indicate, for the sake of knowing-it-all, that the concept of a living master is entertained by several hindu sects in that region, like Advait Mat, Sant Mat and Rhadasoami ::::Let's leave it to the scholars. I have resisted the temptation to insert excuses or lengthy explanations. Even your above suggestion is hopelessly flawed if not simply because tSant Mat and Radhasoami are not Hindu Sects. In fact they are more allied to a Sikh tradition I believe. I don't want to go there. I simply want to balance the existing reference to Sant Mat by including Ron Geaves' alternate view - his distinction that the lineage is Advait Mat. Your argument is very odd since Rawat's father's guru was apparently Swarupanand from Advait Mat (early DLM literature also claims this, including Shri Hans' own book Hans Yog Prakash) and Rawat and Geaves have probably confirmed this expressly to clear up confusion with Radhasoami who had a similarly named guru.  Geaves certainly says as much.  ",0,0

"  == Candelabra hypothesis ==  Sorry i was away for a while, just saw your comment.  The term 'Candelabra' was coined by William White Howells (Mankind in the Making, 1959) to describe Coon's view of the origin of the races. Its completely incorrect, but nonetheless the only term which has ever been used to describe Coon's evolutionary model. Its incorrect because Howell's misinterpretated Weidenreich's polycentric (multiregional) origin of the races, which actually includes large amounts of gene-flow (regional interbreeding) when he wrongly believed it was a parallel (polygenic) model of the races. However Coon stressed far less on this gene-flow, but still allowed for it. So basically neither Weidenreich nor Coon's multiregionalism is true parallel or polygenic evolution, however Coon's model comes far closer to it, as his model doesn't take much interbreeding into account, his geneflow is very minimal. Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Human Evolution pp. 114-115 (see on google books) has a full discussion, pointing all this out. Coon also believed the racial developments and splits were long before sapienization, and that they were present in archaic homo and even earlier. If you read his Racial Adaptations (1982) he briefly discusses his idea that the Australopithecine's were already split into the races, for example he sees Mongoloid dental traits in one regional variation. However true polyphyletic or polygenism models on the origins of the races died out in the late 19th century. Karl Vogt for example argued the different races were never at any one point related, and that they evolved from different primates.   ",0,0

"Atabek again when you call Kasravi a pan-Iranian nationalists and not acceptable, then I can call Tapper an anthropologist which he is.  If Kasravi is quoted by scholars such as Minorsky, Frye, Savory then his historical works are obviously acceptable.  Also note this: []  Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Sources should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require stronger sources. See Wikipedia:Verifiability#Sources..  Note that is why I quote from Savory a Safavid historian and say that he is stronger source than Tapper who is an anthropologist.  And furthermore I asked for direct proof with regards to your statement.  Actually you quote says: Esmail I proclaimed himself Shah of Azerbaijan.  Now I ask where?  And then you bring me a quote from Tapper who is an anthropologist.  Then I of course say that Savory who is a Safavid historian with much more qualifications does not claim Esmail I made such a proclamation.   It is true that he controlled Gilan also (but perhaps not all of it).. As per Iran , it is mentioned as the country of Safavids by many sources.  Including Sultan Selim I when he attacked Iran.  :::::::: تا ز استانبول لشکر سوی ایران تاختم تاج صوفی غرقه خون و ملامت ساختم.  Thus we have a direct source referring to the country of Esmail I as Iran .  And I do not need to bring direct reference like this because Safavid historians are strong enough source to quote. :::::::: Note I repeat from the source. Although initially ruler of Azerbaijan only, by the year 916/1510 Esma@¿^l was master of the whole of Persia, having crushed the residual forces of the Aq Qoyunlu and driven the Uzbeks out of the northeastern frontier province of Khorasan..  seems correct but either way it is from strong source.  But until we have proof of proclamation from Esmail I himself  I am the Shah of Azerbaijan, then claiming Esmail I proclaimed himself shah of Azerbaijan is not valid.  He proclaimed himself Shah in Azerbaijan is different though as he was crowned in Tarbiz.  And yes he did own part of Gilan as well, and this angle can be argued from Encyclopedia Islam quote which I have brought above already.  So basically I am asking you for the Minorsky quote you mentioned but quoting from an anthropologist when it contradicts Safavid historians or when Safavid historians are stronger source in my opinion is not valid.   :::::::: As per Arbcomm, there are admins I can report personal attacks outside of there and thus I mentioned the warning.

You may go and see the history of the page if you wish to verify this, but all I did was make a comment that was not in agreement with what he said. Because he dislikes me, and because of his paranoia, AND possibly because of other reasons (which I won't go into because he'd just cry about personal attacks), he removed the comments I made. All because they didn't go with what he said and believed. This was immature, selfish, childish and stupid at best, but as I said on another page if he wants to look that way who am I to stop him?  :::Then there is this ``appeared as another blah blah blah as soon as blah blah blah.`` Isn't this funny or what? He has to go and request a checkuser because he can't tell who is who yet he has no problem pulling out the sockpuppet accusation and whipping it around like a cowboy's lasso at a rodeo.

For it would be unthinkable for someone to directly accuse him of the same behavior of which he so loves to accuse others.  :::``Made allegations of stalking`` [ . . . ] ``to paint himself as a victim.`` Did Chad even read what he wrote? Did he realize that he claims I made allegations of stalking to paint myself as a victim yet in the same remarks he claims Wikistalking on himself?

But being a hypocrite is nothing new to him.  :::As for the attacking of the external link  he still has no proof I am that person who he claims that I am. This is the same debacle he got into with .

This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies.   If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ``db`` tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.    `",0,0

And what about this earlier comment, and I quote: ...the whole reason a Royal Commission was appointed in the first place to sort out Maltese titles was because a whole whopping lot of people demanded recognition of this title and that purportedly granted to some ancestor or another by the crowned head of some ephemeral state or another. It'd also be interesting to know why the British bothered at all, instead of dismissing the whole business as gimcrackery from a tiny island with a contemporaneous population similar to Southwark, which would have been consistent behavior from them.

"`  Laveol: Even last name Kolisev is a Macedonian one. Last names ending with ``ev``, ``ov`` are not Bulgarian. It happens that you have those in Bulgaria. But you have those last names in Macedonia, Russia, Check Republic, and so on.  Kolisev is a Macedonian last name. Same is Kolisevski. You can find both kinds with ``ov|ova``, ``ev|eva``, ``vski/vska``, ``ski/ska`` and others in Republic of Macedonia. So changing a last name from Kolisev to Kolisevski does not have any Bulgarian/AntiBulgarian implications. My last name is ``Janev``. You can find in Macedonia also ``Janevski``, ``Janeski``. All of those are Macedonian last names. The fact that you can have ``Janev`` in Bulgaria does not translate to ethnicity/origin claims in Macedonia.  Here are some last names that finish on ``ov``, ``ev`` and are not Bulgarian neither Macedonian:  [Sergei Lavrov] [Anton Chekhov] [Martina Navratilova]  So these last name endings are typical but not exclusive for some of the Slavic languages. Same is with ``vski/vska``, ``ski/ska``, ``ich`` which are shared between a number of Slavic languages.  To come back to Kolisevski: Kolisevski is a Macedonian last name, as well is Kolisev. If you can find a person living in Bulgaria with one of those last names, and probably you could not, does not gives any conclusion about ethnicity or being a Pro-Bulgarian.   `",0,0

However, because very few prostate cancers were detected at Gleason scores of 8 to 10, it is difficult to draw conclusions about this group.`` From this text, I think it would be appropriate to say something like - In contrast to the FDA's stance, the National Cancer Institute believes that finasteride may increase the ability to detect cancer which accounts for the higher prevalance of high-grade cancer.

"  I cited an article she wrote in a Blackwell Companion. Please look up the Blackwell Companion series. Blackwell writes major companions for entire fields of philosophy. They dedicate a staff to searching an entire field for the most reliable and recognized experts in a field and then they each write chapters in a text. It is extremely, extremely difficult to write an article in a Blackwell Companion. If nobody 'took her seriously' she wouldn't have been selected to write it.  In addition, all of the articles I linked were in peer reviewed journals. It would be different if they were random things she just put out on the internet or something, but these are serious texts.  In addition, I am NOT a student of Professor Sher. I was asked to write the article by two of her students. I would not write an article on someone I knew personally. I AM a researcher in philosophical logic. I myself am an expert in the field, and well equipped to access significance.   Etchemendy's arguments were major. Her arguments were the significant reply. Why don't you question the length and breadth of the John Etchemendy article, which cites no links to any work, no academic sources, and only a biography webpage from his office?

Actually at this point I don't care...I'm tired of the insanity.....I have other things to do, and this nonsense is too time-consuming anyway.  For real.

I'm not the only one he's upset with his constant edit warring and disrespect.  So you looking only at me, and misunderstanding my words and my intent.    I was seriously planning to be done with Wikipedia for a long while anyway.

He's an insufferable joke.  And I don't care that it's a personal attack. Since I'm blocked anyway, I might as well make it worth it.   He should just get lost from all articles, he adds nothing but aggravation and a barrage of insanity.      :Again, I'm NOT the only one who's been a victim of his crazy nonsense.    Yet that nutball stays unblocked, yet he is the CAUSE of it all the problems.    Interesting.

Much to my chagrin.   I have better (for real) things to do.    I don't care that much that I'm blocked......but it's the principle that it's sort of unfair, and you misunderstand (and actually twisted) my words around.....and this maniac (more personal attacks, so I'm making it good) gets off basically scott-free.......EVEN THOUGH I CAN SHOW YOU EXAMPLES OF WHERE HE'S BEEN AN INSUFFERABLE TARD WITH OTHER PEOPLE TOO.    You'll overlook that of course.     Cuz Nova knows how to manipulate WP and WP Admins fairly well, I've noticed.    Though I know that some Admins see his nonsense too.

Viruses are also considered to be part of this category although some scientists argue they are not alive, they have also made contributions to molecular laboratory techniques (ex. using retroviruses to insert target DNA into a host cell genome).  Selaginella I learned in second year genetics from David Smith that these plants have very interesting Post transcriptional RNA editing, where many of the cytosine nucleotides are changed to uracil nucleotides, resulting in an RNA transcript that looks quite different from its template DNA.

At the same time, the internet is bulging at the seams with information showing that Detroit is where Techno was birthed.

"  :The 'arguments' above consist of reiteration. I also disagree that there are significant differences between anime and animation; certainly the latter covers a far wider stylistic range and anime could be described as a subset derived from the development of particular forms of mass production (which are also found in animation from other countries, whether the USA, Korea, or anywhere else making significant amounts for the mass market); this definition would exclude Miyazaki (who, indeed, excludes himself, unlike his western fans). Likewise men in monster suits and miniature work are hardly unique to a particular national tradition. Yes, the Ultraman tradition represents as much of a speciality as Marvel/DC superheroes, and certainly deserves a specific article, but this is not the same as Tokusatu. Ergo, Tokusatu is not a genre.   should not be so quick to assume what people do and don't know about; my original comment may have been sharp but was in response to an I-will-not-be-questioned tone, and I certainly know enough to contribute to this article.

"` ::::To you, perhaps, but then, you had the unambiguous term ``winningest`` to help you.  |    ===Ambiguity=== The problem with ``most successful`` is that it's ambiguous, since ``most successful`` can, in general, be defined along many metrics: most sold, most manufactured, greatest market share, and, yes, greatest number of races won using the bike. ``Winningest`` works along one metric  or two, if one is being deliberately obtuse as to what ``winning`` means in context of a racing bike. So why not pick a perfectly standard word that avoids ANY ambiguity?  And contrary to Skyring's fake usage claims, ``winningest`` is a perfectly standard word:  * The Grammarist: :Most participial adjectives are made comparative and superlative with more and most. For example, we say more troubling and most sickening instead of troublinger and sickeningest. So, to many English-speakers, the superlative adjective winningest—meaning having the most wins—sounds wrong. And indeed some peevish grammarians hate the word. Yet despite the existence of grammatically unquestionable alternatives (most winning, best), winningest is deeply entrenched in sports commentary and is not going away any time soon. Those who dislike it might as well get used to it.  :Google News searches show winningest has been common since the 1940s, and there are scattered examples from earlier. The word has always been confined mainly to American and Canadian publications. (This is also confirmed by Google Ngram)  *My copy of the OED 2nd Edition  while it doesn't have usage notes  uses ``winningest`` in three of their example quotes for the ``winning`` entry. So the OED editors don't have a problem with it, either. |  `",0,0

I've already gone through and pared the list down during the AfD, and flagged about half of the rest as unreferenced.  If only the referenced sections were kept, that would still be substantially larger than the target size you advocate. In my mind, another AfD in a month or two would be a more straightforward way to handle it: either the list meets notability guidelines or it doesn't, but calling it a ``merge`` and deleting 90+% of the content is not the right way to get rid of the article.    :::*The problem with going back to AfD is that the system is completely hit or miss.

"`  == Synonyms ==  Hello anonymous user, in this edit (11 June 2014), you removed the name Drepanodon Leidy, 1861, from the synonymy of Mosasaurus, stating in the summary that Drepanodon is a synonym of the cave bear. You did not mention a source for this, and you might be right, but first of all, you did not show you realized there are two taxa named Drepanodon. The first one is Drepanodon Nesti, 1826, which was classified as a member of the Felidae when published; the second one is the junior homonym Drepanodon Leidy, 1861, the one that is listed in the synonymy of Mosasaurus. As you did not mention any justification for your edit, I restored the name Drepanodon Leidy to the synonymy of Mosasaurus. An extra reason for me to do this, was that it would be far more likely for the older name, given to the remains of a carnivore, to apparently represent another species of carnivore, than it would be for a name given to saurian remains. Confusion of the names was what most likely happened here, as far as I can see.  In the same edit, you removed the name M. copeanus Marsh, 1869, from the list of invalid or dubious species, because the name had been synonymized with Plioplatecarpus depressus. The idea of this list is to summarize names that have been associated with the generic name Mosasaurus, but are no longer recognized as valid species in that genus. If such a name is eventually synonymized with a taxon in another genus, then just removing it from the list is removing information. On the other hand, adding the name for which it is now considered a synonym gives extra information. Especially if someone stumbles upon a name in Mosasaurus somewhere, and wants to find out more about it, and so decides to look up Mosasaurus in the encyclopedia, it would be most helpful when the accepted name is provided.  One last thing: am I right in suspecting you to be the same user as , another user with a keen interest in saurians but lacking that extra bit of skills in the field of taxonomy?    `",0,0

"`  The followers of Claude Vorilhon call him ``His Holiness``; what do you think of that? If they called him ``Holy Father``, would that be legitimate? The pretension of a title does not mean that you ACTUALLY possess that title. The coptic ``patriarch`` DOESN’T  have the right of being called ``His Holiness``, ``Holy Father`` nor ``Pontiff``, because these titles are CLEARLY and OBVIOUSLY CATHOLICS and they belong to the CATHOLIC tradition. However, your ``patriarch`` is COPTIC.  You should be ashamed of doing so base usurpations and so unfounded interpolations. And, in addition to everything else, you dare to put your ``patriarch`` before the POPE. When editing the english Wikipedia, remember always that it is in the WEST, not in Africa. But the most absurd of all is that you want to have reason.  I will say again, give up of your (absurd, ridiculous and  illegitimate) claims. You know that the   cause of all these usurpations is nothing but envy. By copying things of the Catholic Church, you acknowledge the inferiority of  your religion itself.

"`  ==The Battle of Tulifinny == The date is December 9, 1864, and the place is Tulifinny Creek. Citadel cadets joined with cadets from their sister academy, the Arsenal in Columbia, to form the Battalion of State Cadets. This was different from the Cadet Company. They had been ordered to protect the Tulifinny trestle of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad. The mural depicts the cadets repulsing the attack. North Reference Room  Primary Source listed along with info below: http://sciway3.net/clark/jasper/towns.htm  ``Before long, firing sounded in Charlestonthe shots that were to blast in pieces this tenurial Southern existence. Grimmer and blacker for the South, the war years rolled slowly on. And on November 30, 1864, there occurred near Grahamville the battle of Honey Hill. For Beaufort District, it meant the beginning of the end.  Many stories of this battle have been told and written. An authentic and complete account was written in 1899 by Captain Ben Williams, of Brunson, who was a participant, was then adjutant of his regiment. His articles were published in the News and Courier and in the Hampton County Guardian.  Outnumbered five to one, a little band of South Carolina cavalry, infantry and Citadel cadets faced a Federal naval expedition which had advanced up Broad River and disembarked at Boyd’s landing (or Salvesberg, the local name). The enemy’s destination was Grahamville Depot; their real objective the destruction of the railway track according to Sherman’s orders.  With seven guns, a well-built breastwork, and the superb strategy of Colonel Charles Jones Colcock, who commanded the Third Military District of the state, the little Confederate band inflicted on the invaders losses amounting to nearly 8oo in a few action-packed hours. Colonel Colcock was everywhere, according to other officers. He even enlisted a strong, blowing wind on his side, having his men to fire a field of broomstraw, so that the flames were hurled into the faces of the enemy at a critical moment. Reinforcements of Georgia Reserves arrived from Savannah hours later, under General Gustavus W. Smith, but the general refused to take over the actual command from one whose ability and success had proved so outstanding. Tales have been told by many elderly local people of the surrounding roads literally running with Negro blood, because more than half the Federal force was made up of Negro regiments trained at Hilton Head. ``You could walk on dead Negroes for miles,`` they declared. Old manuscripts tell further of bodies hastily buried in trenches; of later washing rains exposing a gruesome welter of arms and legs. These bodies later received decent burial in the Federal cemetery at Beaufort.  An interesting side light on this battle is the fact that a local Negro, Allen Orr, participated. (He was proud of his service on the Confederate side). As a teen-age boy he went into this battle in which so many of his race were slain, ``Went with a white friend to take care of the horses.`` He lived until a few years ago. At the age of 100 years-plus, he enjoyed giving a pantomime of the manner in which he dodged behind the breastwork as the bullets were flying. The breastwork is evident for all to see. A number of cannon balls have been excavated at the site.```",0,0

Bullying is by no means the sole precursor to suicide, and suicide is not the inevitable result of bulling. You state that it is a neologism. In 2001 it was. Many years have passed since then and the term is in common parlance. It is, indeed, the common name of suicide the is a direct result of bullying.

"  == Totally irrelevant, ego-driven drivel ==  And, for the record, NO, this is not a personal attack, just an observation on the total pointlessness of this entry...  Maybe we should all put our CV's on Wikipedia, but I thought that Wiki was attempting to become a credible medium of encyclopeadic information on the Internet, not for self-publicity seeking ego merchants to paste up their life story and that of their woefully un-spectacular personal and family histories.  This entire entry is no more suitable for a page than my life's contribution to the study of Ethiopian-styles of ballroom dancing. It belongs on a Wiki personal page and no more.  Considering that my family tree can be traced to before the Norman invasion of England and I hold an hereditary title (which was once owned by Elizabeth I and Francis Bacon) maybe I could start posting up my little life story and my g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-uncles and g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-grand-daddies and which castles they built, etc. (yawn)  But there again, I am not a vain, egotistical numpty who wants to use Wikipedia as an online CV service - I do wonder if the crypto-consultancy industry needs a few heads at the moment... Hmmmmmmmmmm.  (I only mention dear old Lizzie the First and Nick Bacon as they have actually been heard of by most people)... not becuase I wish to pump up my ego.

Now, if you read that guideline, you may understand why in general AIG and many of the other sources you used are not reliable sources.``  Hey JoshuaZ the liar, where does Wikipedia's policy say that AnswersInGensis.org is not a reliable source? Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, ``Now`` is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?  JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.  Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, ``Now`` is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?  Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:  Joshua also said:  ``In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.``  Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?  Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:  ``ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using ``Darwinist`` as a slur somewhat irrelevant;``  Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?  ``if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.``  Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!  ``I suggest you calm down``  I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?  I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:  ``Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil.`` - Ephesians 4:26-27  Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's.   ``and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.``  Oh the old ``you need to read it but I don't`` and ``you sit and think while your grounded young man`` insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.  I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.  I'll enhance the list for you:  Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.  And Joshua also said:  ``This is in addition to issues of original research in regard to Biblical prophecies and other issues on the Charles Darwin page.``  Wow you sure like to weasel-word: ``other issues``? What are you references for this vague ``other issues`` JoshuaZ the Policy Master of Wikpedia?  And Joshua, who said anything about prophecies? Where did Starfire777 say anothing about prophecies? No JoshuaZ the wannabe scholar, he said ``predicted`` in the same way that science can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment. If your lazy-brained truth-careless self had been paying attention to what he said CARE FULL Y you might have noticed that the verses were using PAST TENSE JOSHUA, not FUTURE TENSE JOSHUA. If you are unable to tell the difference between past tense and future tense, what business do you have playing judge? If you are unable to figure out the difference between multiple meanings of words and are quick to judge (that means rushing carelessly to judge) what business do you have being a judge? Big duh right there. Here you go Joshua, read the verses again, and please explain how you missed that they are past tense:  ``For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they BECAME [PAST TENSE JOSHUA] futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Claiming to be wise, they BECAME fools, and EXCHANGED the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things. Therefore God GAVE them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen. For this reason God GAVE them up to dishonorable passions. For their women EXCHANGED natural relations for those that are contrary to nature;  and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.``  Did those caps help Joshua? Were those big enough hints for you? And Joshua, since when is the Christian teaching that ignoring God leads to homosexuality, ``original``? Are you blind? Did those plainly worded verses (they aren't metaphors genius) pose to great a challenge for your mind to understand? Where have you been while Christians for the past 100 years have been preaching that turing away from God leads to homosexuality? Well you fake religion expert? Well lying Joshua? Where ya been Mr. Judge of Christianity? Can we see your degrees in religion and Christian history oh Expert Judge JoshuaZ? Got any references for us that can be substantiated and verified? Lol. Not.  So, again, what business do you have judging?  Take a hint from God, your master who you are mocking and disobeying:  ``Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.`` Proverbs 26:12  Fool in ancient Hebrew means ``very wicked person``. So there is more hope for a very evil man then for you Joshua.  ``A man who remains stiff-necked after many rebukes will suddenly be destroyed—without remedy.``   Reference? From Proverbs 29:1, in the Bible, the best selling most archeologically and scientifically verified historical record in the world. Reference?:  See Scientifically and Archeologically Substantiated and Verified Books Proving the Accuracy of the Bible.  I suggest you play catch up with me, Starfire, and the other 30+ million Calvinists, including the scientists among them who you don't hold a candle to.  Joshua, lose the smug, bitter and hateful attitude and realize this truth: Just because you didn't call anyone a moron or hypocrite doesn't mean you are not personally attacking, not being hateful, and not insulting. Do you understand that truth Joshua? It's very simple, it doesn't take a genius to understand. Learn what ``passive aggressive`` means too.  Personal attacks are not whatever you say they are, nor is a personal attack unjustified if you are vandalizing Wikipedia. You, a PERSON, are attacking Starfire, A PERSON, on Wikipedia, so stop acting surprised when you are attacked back. Lose the God complex, the ``Do as I say not as I do attitude`` Joshua.  Note: JoshuaZ's lies against Starfire777 (lies which are ultimately against God) can be found in the ``User Starfire777 Baited by Darwinists and Blocked`` htm file which is in the ``Banning Christian Editors Using Unsubstantiated Accusations`` folder.

"  ==  ==  I don't know if you remember Wikipedia:Contributor copyright investigations/Scarfaced Charley from over a year ago – I see he was also blocked as a Sockpuppet. I worked a bit on helping fix some of those.  Yesterday I found that Scarfaced Charley had made a duplicate Campaignbox template and therefore some relevant articles were using that Template:Campaignbox Little Rock while others were using the preexisting Template:Campaignbox Advance on Little Rock which follows the WP:MILHIST convention of naming campaignboxes in accordance with the campaigns defined by the American Battlefield Protection Program unit of the National Park Service. That site is currently unavailable because of the Government Shutdown, but can be verified in Google's cache.  I merged the content into Template:Campaignbox Advance on Little Rock, updated all the articles to use the correct campaignbox template, blanked the duplicate template and tagged it with db-t3. I had originally also put a redirect to the corrected template, but I couldn't figure out how to make both the redirect and the db-3 tag work... Hopefully I've done it correctly. Does this situation indeed qualify for speedy deletion or does it need to be brought to TfD?   Also, there's one talkpage comment at Template talk:Campaignbox Little Rock. What's the proper way to handle that?  Thanks.   ",0,0

" :::::Please understand that I am not expressing any of my own (amazingly empiricist) views of the subject matter in what follows, only my views on policy. I hope not to fan flames higher by offering up a contentious but universally accessible parallel: There's a reason why  is cited in the article on Evolution. Now, in this case anyone alive in America knows that this is a significant view, even if scientific consensus rules it false or at least unreasonable. But anecdotally, I can tell you that there is significant questioning of Nonviolent Communication (as a theory and movement) and that Gorsevski's (admittedly poorly written) critique does represent this strand of rarely-surfacing criticism. Since Nonviolent Communication is dismissed as sheer quackery in some other disciplines, it is unsurprising that there are few critiques in print, just as, despite the vast importance in society of the intelligent design debate, the percentage of evolutionary biologists discussing intelligent design (especially in their scholarly works) is vanishingly low. All of this is to say, in response to Rhentworth, that I agree with other editors that academic publication is fine evidence for significance and that we are not in the business of dismissing research that is bad. I agree with you, Rhentworth, that this article is far from the best, and that the countervailing academic community has done poorly in having little expressed the reasons for its dubiousness. However, there are statements like http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/40238203.pdf?acceptTC=true (ironically, a somewhat critical review of the Gorsevski book in question) that attest to the view that Nonviolent Communication, non-violent rhetoric, and non-violence in general are hopelessly utopian (p. 95), quite a different criticism from the narrow ones raised by Gorsevski, and one that is more widely held.

Sam was the kid who always smelled like shit (moreso on the occasions he actually shit himself). Sam has a collection of awesome dragon shirts. Sam was a genius, too. It always puzzled me what he was doing barely passing his classes in elementary and middle school. Perhaps his superior mind just wandered. Sam would often tell us about and draw pictures of his English girlfriend, who flew to america every weekend to fuck him. On special occasions Sam would share with us selections of the many books he had written. Yeah Sam had it made.  So I was curious of the life Sam was leading now, a year after he has graduated High School. Is he returning for his sophomore year at Oxford? Is he happily married to his stick figure with huge tits?  well, I've kept him in the dark long enough, so say hello to Sam!

Anyways, I would appreciate accessing this information if you could help out.  Thanks in advanced.      Nevermind my pervious request.  I have since found an archive of the page.  It would be helpful if you conformed to filing explanations for your deletions.  Please don't take this request personally; I am only asking that you be considerate, as you are deleting people's time and efforts.  I hope you have a happy holiday season and new year!       :As far as I can tell, Genealogical relationships of Presidents of the United States and List of United States Presidents by genealogical relationship were deleted by other administrators, not me.

You have deleted a page that has existed for many years with no apparent rationale.

The rationale was clearly given: ``Expired PROD, concern was: Notability has not been established, lacks significant coverage in secondary sources``. Even with my attempt to look for reliable sources, there was hardly anything that established notability of the company. —    ::What does it take to establish notability? In general all airlines are considered to be notable, See Wikipedia:WikiProject Aviation/Notability which says ``All airline companies``.  But if you want to delete one you can delete Aspiring Air which is no longer in business.  When you put it back I can put a list of sources such as from the New York Times     :::There's a general notability guideline that will show a general idea of what an article should contain.

If you would like specific diffs, I can get them for you. He has spent the last few days virtually stalking  and reversing virtually every edit made. And as I said, he's been blocked for this behavior before, so this is hardly an isolated incident. I stand by my block.    :Thanks for your response.

What the hell does this nasty comment mean? And where is fucking logic in your edits to that article? You kept (although biased) my important thesises, but reverted other non-political issues like terms in the lead. So what are you trying to do? Promote some point or just provoke a conflict?  Discuss issues before changing them in the article. Or you'll get a real war till the last drop of my blood you mother fucker!!!  ===Wow=== That's the most amazing message I've ever seen at my talk and I've seen a lot. I regret my first thought to remove it. Better yet, I will keep it. Let it shine! Thanks, Alex!    I figured I place links here to the past messages from the same contributor left at my talk that are now in archives and not in the plain view:  *November, 2005: original, ``modified`` *March 2005 a nice welcoming me to Wiki That's it for now.    === Re: Your request of evaluation ===  Hi. Yesterday you requested my evaluation of your behaviour, and here it is: *you ARE ``the shame`` in Wikipedia *but you can't be ``a shame on the Ukrainian community`` since you don't belong to such  In case if you need assessment of your activities, just use a special purpose register .    :I am moving your entry to a desginated section I specifically marked for you at my talk. I don't remember requesting your opinion of myself since you made it public at your disgusting talk page. Since you expressed it, I stopped caring. If you keep trolling, you visit here will be short. If you somehow undergo a major transformation and manage to stay, this would be just fine as far as I am conserned. I don't feel good though being a subject of your obsession. Not that I care myself, but it is rather unhealthy for your own sake.     Guys, stop it. Irpen, don't call his talk page ``disgusting``. Alex's user page is one of the cleverest I've seen, better than yours. Irpen, don't build a wall.   :His user talk is an attack page as well as most of his entries into the article's and personal talks. I have a wall between myself and people with a filthy mouth. There is nothing to build. When he makes edits or suggestions outside of his crusade venue, I will respond disregarding his past offences, as I did just today at talk:Viktor Yushchenko. When he just plainly trolls, he is just banging his head against the wall. I have enough patience to stand through far worse things than his bad mouth.    ::No, you don't have a wall between yourself ``and people with a filthy mouth``. If you were you would have treated Kuban Kazak differently. ::You are trying to build a wall with AlexPU and came to the point at which you release yourself from any productive articles' discuss with AlexPU. That would be a wrong point.   Dear 134, your comparison of AlexPU with Kuban kazak is totally improper because: *I did chastise KK rather strongly after his spats of incivility (which apparently worked, btw) and if he keeps being uncivil Ezhiki will block him sooner than any other admin and if he gets blocked, I would never interfere (this has been discussed) *Kazak, compared to AlexPU is a teacher in the good manners school. *Most of Kazak's contributions at talk pages are civil while almost all talk entries by AlexPU range between incivil and horrific (like the one above that beats all the records). I don't remember seeing you criticizing AlexPU on the issues (from which I infer that you view him uncivil but with the right POV). At the same time I gad frequent disagreements with Kazak (and Ghirla) on the article's talk pages. Examples are abundant. That said, I do treat each edit from any editor even guilty of whatever trolling in the past based on its own merit. Examples are abundant but if you doubt that, let me know and I will give you diffs. Best,   :AlexPU definitely has some specific knowledge, and he is a journalist, so it would valuable for the project if he is around. He basically created the article on Rudnev, adding that story on Kovpak/Rudnev conflict, which probably the other had no idea of, and on which I actually put “fact” template, as without a reference the story sounds questionable. Also, speaking on who should be a teacher for whom, it seems that AlexPU has got your civility message pretty fast. But we will see…    AlexPU claims that he is a journalist but his Rudniev article is a bunch of unreferenced speculations and conspiracy theories. It also included false claims, like his beeing not a communist. I am writing a replacement now. I would love to see the material restored in the referenced form. He got no message on the civilty whatsoever. I've been here longer than you and I've seen this editor. That he simply makes no edits now is the reason why we don't see his diatribes. As soon as he is back, they will resume. Fortunately, Wikipedia has got much less tolerant to such behavior lately. More often than not we see instant blocks of some fellows without even an ArbCom. If he returns as a civil editor, that would be a different story.        ==Prometheism 2== Sorry I haven't been able to work on the article!

  WTF is up with this page? http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/User:Sir_james_paul,1,1
"`  ::::Controversy:  Your point here is well taken but for the fact a person can be well aware of possible distinctions in terminology and still call a magazine a clip.  In actuality, it is the ``firearm experts`` that insist on a controversy by way of insisting on their terminology.  In other words, because they have taken issue with the layman's wording they have indeed made it controversial and not the other way around.  So while the distinction in wording may not be controversial within their circle of buddies they are in fact responsible for the controversy.    ::::M-W Dictionary:  When I say ``the dictionary`` clearly I'm referring to ``the dictionary`` I cited before in this case M-W.  I am a ``cognitive miser`` like anyone that takes short cuts when I can, just as you shortened it to M-W.  Rather than grasp at straws in dissecting ones arguments let us focus on the big picture when we know what each other means.  I agree the dictionary isn't for giving an exhaustive description, that's what encyclopedias are for.  However in this instance it does shed some light on ``the controversy`` as it does indeed define a clip as also a magazine.  The reason for including it is not to give people a better understanding of the differences between types of clips or the different types of magazines.  The purpose of including it is to show the other side of the controversy and according to my research within Wikipedia this is entirely acceptable.    ::::Agreement: Clearly some people don't agree with M-W just as you and I don't agree with SAAMI's statement that people sometimes refer to ``cartridge clips`` as ``magazines``.  The ``experts`` on weapon's have this fact somewhat backwards and are incorrect as they should state that people refer to ``magazines`` as ``clips``.  Just because you and I disagree with SAAMI's statement doesn't mean it should be taken out as a reference and I'd never suggest that.  ::::What I suggest is a compromise.  I agree with you about the references regarding Remington and Marlin as that does seem to fall under OR.  M-W however doesn't fall under OR as it is a published source and being a leader in its industry it could be argued is the authority on word use.  Do you have any suggestions on how it could be incorporated so as to show how this controversy is perpetuated?  Without saying it's wrong because it clearly isn't according to common usage.  I'm thinking something like this....Clip technically defined.....use to describe magazine is controversial....however M-W defines it as such.  ::::This allows readers to see their is a difference in terms, there is a controversy, and why it potentially exists or is perpetuated.  I think this is fair.  Note well that I never attempted to remove any sources that backed up what you're saying here.  I'm not interested in destroying your view, only presenting both sides fairly.  `",0,0
